Still drowning in grief after the tragic murder of his fiancee, Dewey has seemingly lost his focus, his edge, and the confidence of his superiors. A high-level Russian hacker, known only as Cloud, is believed to be behind a series of major terror operations, and the mission is to capture and render Cloud harmless. At the same time, a backup team is sent after the only known associate of Cloud, a ballerina believed to be his girlfriend. Unwilling to sit out the mission as ordered, Dewey defies his superiors and goes rogue, surreptitiously following and tracking the two teams. What should be a pair of simple snatch-and-grab operations goes horribly wrong - both teams are ambushed and wiped out. Only through the unexpected intervention of Dewey is the backup operation salvaged. Cloud's girlfriend reveals a shocking secret - a plot so audacious and deadly that the masterminds behind it would risk anything and kill anybody to prevent its exposure. It's a plot that, in less than three days, will completely remake the world's political landscape and put at risk every single person in the Western world. On the run, with no backup and with only three days left, Dewey Andreas must unravel and stop this plot or see everything destroyed.

Filled with a sense of adventure and national pride, they left their parents' homes wearing their best clothes and confidently waving good-bye. Believing they were going to work in a factory for a few months, they were eager to report for government service. Instead, the young women - many of them teenagers - were sent to Auschwitz. Their government paid 500 Reich Marks (about $200) apiece for the Nazis to take them as slave labor. Of those 999 innocent deportees, only a few would survive.</p> <p>The facts of the first official Jewish transport to Auschwitz are little known, yet profoundly relevant today. These were not resistance fighters or prisoners of war. There were no men among them. Sent to almost certain death, the young women were powerless and insignificant not only because they were Jewish - but also because they were female. Now acclaimed author Heather Dune Macadam reveals their poignant stories, drawing on extensive interviews with survivors, and consulting with historians, witnesses, and relatives of those first deportees to create an important addition to Holocaust literature and women's history.</p>","releaseDate":"2019-12-31","publishers":[{"name":"Tantor Audio"}],"length":"13h 13m ","categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Europe","url":"18573582011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/019282/bk_tant_019282_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51oKM1zUDVL","asin":"0063036061","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"When We Were Young & Brave","authors":"Hazel Gaynor","narrators":"Rosie Jones, Imogen Church","length":"11 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"61TN2UmMSiL","asin":"1549101528","title":"They Went Left","authors":"Monica Hesse","narrators":"Caitlin Davies","length":"9 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"61R6mWvJyCL","asin":"1549141902","subHeading":"My Journey to Uncover the Cost of Saving a Life","title":"Lightning Flowers","authors":"Katherine E.

His source was a high-level Iranian government official and his proof was a photo of the bomb itself.

Now, to repay his debt, Dewey has to attempt the impossible - to both rescue Meir from one of the world’s most secure prisons and to find and eliminate Iran’s nuclear bomb before it’s deployed - all without the help or sanction of Israel or America (at the near certain risk of detection by Iran). </p> <p>Unfortunately, Dewey’s first moves have caught the attention of Abu Paria, the brutal and brilliant head of VEVAK, the Iranian secret service.

Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. </p> <p>Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself - and that now her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first. </p> <p>Bringing to life Weir's brash, whip-smart protagonist is actress Rosario Dawson (Marvel's <i>The Defenders</i>, <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Death Proof</i>). With the breathless immediacy of one realizing they're one cracked helmet visor away from oblivion, Dawson deftly captures Jazz's first-person perspective – all while delivering sarcastic Weir-ian one-liners and cracking wise in the face of death. And with a cast of diverse characters from all walks of life calling Artemis home, Dawson tonally somersaults to voice Kenyan prime ministers, Ukrainian scientists, and Saudi welders. It's a performance that transports listeners right alongside Jazz, matching her step for step on every lunar inch of her pulse-pounding journey. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-11-14","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"8h 57m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574621011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/027881/bk_adbl_027881_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"414J3xG+7+L","asin":"B082BHJMFF","title":"The Martian","authors":"Andy Weir","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","length":"10 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"41BUYlD-sfL","asin":"B00VN0Q8XY","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Armada","authors":"Ernest Cline","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","length":"11 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"516MN+bKViL","asin":"0593396960","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Ready Player Two","authors":"Ernest Cline","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","length":"13 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"514eYOli8TL","asin":"B071CGXYVJ","title":"James Moriarty, Consulting Criminal","authors":"Andy Weir","narrators":"Graeme Malcolm","length":"1 hr and 10 mins"},{"cover":"514MNgIFiSL","asin":"B088C4DBYP","subHeading":"Bobiverse, Book 4","title":"Heaven's River","authors":"Dennis E.

Col. Dan Hampton was a leading member of the Wild Weasels, the elite Air Force fighter squadrons whose mission is recognized as the most dangerous job in modern air combat. Weasels are the first planes sent into a war zone, flying deep behind enemy lines purposely seeking to draw fire from surface-to-air missiles and artillery. They must skillfully evade being shot down - and then return to destroy the threats, thereby making the skies safe for everyone else to follow. Today these vital missions are more hazardous than direct air-to-air engagement with enemy aircraft. Hampton's record number of strikes on high-value targets make him the most lethal F-16 Wild Weasel pilot in American history. This is his remarkable story. </p> <p>Taught to fly at an early age by his father, Hampton logged twenty years and 608 combat hours in the world's most iconic fighter jet: the F-16 \"Fighting Falcon\", or \"Viper\" as its pilots call it. Hampton spearheaded the 2003 invasion of Iraq, leading the first flight of fighters over the border en route to strike Baghdad. In the war that followed, he engaged in a series of brilliantly executed missions that earned him three Distinguished Flying Crosses with Valor; he notably saved a U.S. Marine unit from certain death by taking out the surrounding enemy forces near Nasiriyah. Two years earlier, on 9/11, Hampton's father was inside the Pentagon when it was attacked; with his dad's fate unknown, Hampton was scrambled into American skies and given the unprecedented orders to shoot down any unidentified aircraft. Hampton also flew critical missions in the first Gulf War, served on the Air Combat Command staff during the Kosovo War, and was injured in the 1996 Khobar Towers terrorist attack. </p> <p>With manned missions rapidly giving way to remote-controlled UAV drones, <i>Viper Pilot</i> may be the last memoir by a true hero of the skies. Gripping and irreverently humorous, it is an unforgettable look into the closed world of fighter pilots and modern air combat. </p>","releaseDate":"2012-10-02","publishers":[{"name":"HarperAudio"}],"length":"9h 53m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Military & War","url":"18571992011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/003144/bk_harp_003144_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51o69Rl5A9L","asin":"B00K0THOZA","subHeading":"Fighter Pilots and Air Combat, from the Red Baron to the F-16","title":"Lords of the Sky","authors":"Dan Hampton","narrators":"John Pruden","length":"17 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"61Qay3TUNOL","asin":"B00UZMITZ6","title":"The Hunter Killers","authors":"Dan Hampton","narrators":"John Pruden","length":"11 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51-9hID9wCL","asin":"1549113550","subHeading":"An American Story","title":"Topgun","authors":"Dan Pedersen","narrators":"Jim Meskimen","length":"9 hrs and 48 mins"},{"cover":"51S1eDxa3HL","asin":"B003EYPEDM","subHeading":"The Memoirs of Legendary Ace Robin Olds","title":"Fighter Pilot","authors":"Robin Olds, Christina Olds, Ed Rasimus","narrators":"Robertson Dean","length":"17 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"51RV-KF3ZXL","asin":"B015RQOGYM","subHeading":"An Epic Story of Heroism, Friendship, and Sacrifice","title":"Devotion","authors":"Adam Makos","narrators":"Dominic Hoffman","length":"14 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"51HIptCgxZL","asin":"B06Y2L9NKF","subHeading":"Flip Wilson Series, Book 1","title":"Raven One","authors":"Capt.

A Delta Force operator and one-time American hero, he is still trying to make sense of his life - and duty - after a secret mission gone bad. Three years ago, in the mountains of Pakistan, Raynor made a split-second decision to disobey orders - one that got some of his teammates killed and the rest captured. Now he’s been given a second chance to do right by his country, his men, and himself. But Raynor’s shot at redemption comes at a price. </p> <p>A shadowy group of former colleagues has asked Raynor to return, alone, to Pakistan’s badlands. His assignment seems clear: find his missing men and bring them home.

Meanwhile, a ruthless, unknown enemy is on his trail… and he will stop at nothing to make sure that Raynor’s mission is not accomplished.

So why are they on such high alert? Court's high stakes hunt for answers takes him across Southeast Asia and leads to his old friend, Donald Fitzroy, who is being held hostage by the Chinese. Fitzroy was contracted to find Fan Jiang, a former member of an ultra-secret computer warfare unit responsible for testing China's own security systems. And it seems Fan may have been too good at his job - because China wants him dead. The first two kill teams Fitzroy sent to find Fan have disappeared, and the Chinese have decided to \"supervise\" the next operation. What they don't know is that Gentry's mission is to find Fan first and get whatever intel he has to the US.

Instead, the diseases we fear - and the ones that plague us now - are illnesses brought on by the slow accumulation of damage, such as heart disease and cancer. When we worry or experience stress, our body turns on the same physiological responses that an animal's does, but we do not resolve conflict in the same way - through fighting or fleeing. Over time, this activation of a stress response makes us literally sick. Combining cutting-edge research with a healthy dose of good humor and practical advice, <i>Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers</i> explains how prolonged stress causes or intensifies a range of physical and mental afflictions, including depression, ulcers, colitis, heart disease, and more. It also provides essential guidance to controlling our stress responses. This new edition promises to be the most comprehensive and engaging one yet.</p>","releaseDate":"2012-12-31","publishers":[{"name":"Tantor Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development","url":"18574784011"},{"name":"Personal Development","url":"18574800011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/002832/bk_tant_002832_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41CtpF23xUL","asin":"B06XW3MVNF","subHeading":"The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst","title":"Behave","authors":"Robert M.

And that’s the way he likes it. Patrolling the Appalachian mountainside, where his now deceased father taught him how to hunt, is relaxing and connects him to the past.</p> <p>But today is not a typical day on the job. It begins with asking a thief to join him for breakfast. Seeking to set the young man on a better path, Owen invites him to walk the perimeter with him and consider a more honest living. Before their patrol can begin, they discover evidence that the facility has been breached. When Owen’s truck explodes, he’s confused, but ready for whatever might come his way.</p> <p>At least, he thinks he is.</p> <p>A wave of light-bending energy - the Flux - rolls down the mountainside, transporting Owen, and everyone in the nearby town of Black Creek, to October 14, 1985, the day before his father died.

What if you could change it back? </p> <p>In this brilliantly conceived tour de force, Stephen King - who has absorbed the social, political, and popular culture of his generation more imaginatively and thoroughly than any other writer - takes listeners on an incredible journey into the past and the possibility of altering it. </p> <p>It begins with Jake Epping, a 35-year-old English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching GED classes. He asks his students to write about an event that changed their lives, and one essay blows him away: a gruesome, harrowing story about the night more than 50 years ago when Harry Dunning’s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a sledgehammer. Reading the essay is a watershed moment for Jake, his life - like Harry’s, like America’s in 1963 - turning on a dime. </p> <p>Not much later his friend Al, who owns the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the past, a particular day in 1958. And Al enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession - to prevent the Kennedy assassination. </p> <p>So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson, in a different world - of Ike and JFK and Elvis, of big American cars and sock hops and cigarette smoke everywhere. From the dank little city of Derry, Maine (where there’s Dunning business to conduct), to the warmhearted small town of Jodie, Texas, where Jake falls dangerously in love, every turn is leading, eventually of course, to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and to Dallas, where the past becomes heart-stoppingly suspenseful - and where history might not be history anymore. Time-travel has never been so believable. Or so terrifying.</p>","releaseDate":"2011-11-08","publishers":[{"name":"Simon & Schuster Audio"}],"length":"30h 40m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574621011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/005699/bk_sans_005699_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51ygSCNrLWL","asin":"8401025311","title":"22/11/63 [11/22/63]","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Carlos Manuel Vesga","length":"32 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"511oi04Jv4L","asin":"B002V0M190","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Under the Dome","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Raul Esparza","length":"34 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"41xThcH7SLL","asin":"B019WPM4ZM","title":"It","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Steven Weber","length":"44 hrs and 55 mins"},{"cover":"51tpNPQ-XsL","asin":"B07957SPGB","title":"The Outsider","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Will Patton","length":"18 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51--MBnUbWL","asin":"1508279071","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Institute","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Santino Fontana","length":"18 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"51vksp09TJL","asin":"B0077DEH7A","title":"The Stand","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Grover Gardner","length":"47 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"51FGAt5DIZL","asin":"1797121758","title":"Later","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Seth Numrich","length":"6 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51x7OcetxqL","asin":"B00DEL0Z9I","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Doctor Sleep","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Will Patton","length":"18 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"51IP+552f5L","asin":"B01ITNQKC6","title":"The Dead Zone","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"James Franco","length":"16 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51uf6hRTxGL","asin":"B008PEX62M","title":"Salem's Lot","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Ron McLarty, Stephen King","length":"17 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51fL-PdTPHL","asin":"B00J8VK1WY","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Mr. Mercedes","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Will Patton","length":"14 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51bECh4zRHL","asin":"B019HMBEWE","title":"Needful Things","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Stephen King","length":"25 hrs and 11 mins"},{"cover":"51MSG0FzkrL","asin":"B019P21J9O","title":"The Tommyknockers","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Edward Herrmann","length":"27 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"51iMMWNXdlL","asin":"B002UZZ1DE","title":"Bag of Bones","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Stephen King","length":"21 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51n9UELUayL","asin":"B01AVG9FQM","title":"Desperation","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Stephen King","length":"21 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51rRNPTwMHL","asin":"1797104802","title":"If It Bleeds","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Will Patton, Danny Burstein, Steven Weber","length":"15 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"513j4X3mFjL","asin":"B019FQZ9DC","title":"Misery","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Lindsay Crouse","length":"12 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"61Bne-UJNHL","asin":"B019NNU7XE","subHeading":"The Gunslinger","title":"The Dark Tower I","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"7 hrs and 20 mins"}],"added":313},{"asin":"B083C2W9M7","cover":"611SouB-U6L","title":"Extinction Ashes: Extinction Cycle: Dark Age, Book 3","authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Sansbury Smith","url":"B00BVNB3TC"},{"name":"Anthony J.

DEA agent Art Keller has been fighting the war on drugs for 30 years in a blood feud against Adán Barrera, the head of El Federación, the world's most powerful cartel, and the man who brutally murdered Keller's partner. Finally putting Barrera away cost Keller dearly - the woman he loves, the beliefs he cherishes, the life he wants to lead. </p> <p>Then Barrera gets out, determined to rebuild the empire that Keller shattered. Unwilling to live in a world with Barrera in it, Keller goes on a 10-year odyssey to take him down.

What’s more, the author shows that the Industrial Revolution would have been impossible without it. The science of how the drug has evolved to addict us is no less fascinating.

Well, it happened. In Tom Barren's 2016, humanity thrives in a techno-utopian paradise of flying cars, moving sidewalks, and moon bases, where avocados never go bad and punk rock never existed...because it wasn't necessary. </p> <p>Except Tom just can't seem to find his place in this dazzling, idealistic world, and that's <i>before</i> his life gets turned upside down. Utterly blindsided by an accident of fate, Tom makes a rash decision that drastically changes not only his own life, but the very fabric of the universe itself. In a time-travel mishap, Tom finds himself stranded in our 2016, what we think of as the real world. For Tom, our normal reality seems like a dystopian wasteland. </p> <p>But when he discovers wonderfully unexpected versions of his family, his career, and - maybe, just maybe - his soul mate, Tom has a decision to make. Does he fix the flow of history, bringing his utopian universe back into existence, or does he try to forge a new life in our messy, unpredictable reality? Tom's search for the answer takes him across countries, continents, and timelines in a quest to figure out, finally, who he really is and what his future - our future - is supposed to be. </p> <p><i>All Our Wrong Todays</i> is about the versions of ourselves that we shed and grow into over time. It is a story of friendship and family, of unexpected journeys and alternate paths, and of love in its multitude of forms.

It's ever present. Without it, you would die in minutes. And it has an epic story to tell. </p> <p>In <i>Caesar's Last Breath</i>, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Sam Kean takes us on a journey through the periodic table, around the globe, and across time to tell the story of the air we breathe, which, it turns out, is also the story of earth and our existence on it. </p> <p>With every breath, you literally inhale the history of the world. On the Ides of March, 44 BC, Julius Caesar died of stab wounds on the Senate floor, but the story of his last breath is still unfolding; in fact you're probably inhaling some of it now. Of the sextillions of molecules entering or leaving your lungs at this moment, some might well bear traces of Cleopatra's perfumes, German mustard gas, particles exhaled by dinosaurs or emitted by atomic bombs, even remnants of stardust from the universe's creation. </p> <p>Tracing the origins and ingredients of our atmosphere, Kean reveals how the alchemy of air reshaped our continents, steered human progress, powered revolutions, and continues to influence everything we do. Along the way we'll swim with radioactive pigs, witness the most important chemical reactions humans have discovered, and join the crowd at the Moulin Rouge for some of the crudest performance art of all time. Lively, witty, and filled with the astounding science of ordinary life, <i>Caesar's Last Breath</i> illuminates the science stories swirling around us every second. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-07-18","publishers":[{"name":"Hachette Audio"}],"length":"10h 33m ","categories":[{"name":"Science & Engineering","url":"18580540011"},{"name":"Science","url":"18580555011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/hach/003310/bk_hach_003310_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51YLBDHpE2L","asin":"B008GVXXZO","subHeading":"And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code","title":"The Violinist's Thumb","authors":"Sam Kean","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"12 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"51XVQIJvXCL","asin":"1549176056","subHeading":"The True Story of the Renegade Scientists and Spies Who Sabotaged the Nazi Atomic Bomb","title":"The Bastard Brigade","authors":"Sam Kean","narrators":"Ben Sullivan","length":"14 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51K4nsvxjDL","asin":"B00KI10ZPQ","subHeading":"The History of the Human Brain as Revealed by True Stories of Trauma, Madness, and Recovery","title":"The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons","authors":"Sam Kean","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"12 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51eB8PrNwBL","asin":"1644650649","subHeading":"Ancient Wisdom for Today’s World","title":"Think like a Stoic","authors":"Massimo Pigliucci, The Great Courses","narrators":"Professor Massimo Pigliucci","length":"11 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"616Z9aXJ7oL","asin":"B01GOLTYSC","subHeading":"How Tiny Creatures Manipulate Our Behavior and Shape Society","title":"This Is Your Brain on Parasites","authors":"Kathleen McAuliffe","narrators":"Nicol Zanzarella","length":"8 hrs and 20 mins"},{"cover":"51tHkSN+mJL","asin":"B008DF9KY6","subHeading":"The First 4.5 Billion Years, from Stardust to Living Planet","title":"The Story of Earth","authors":"Robert M.

With an original voice that combines fearless curiosity and mordant wit, Caitlin tells an unusual coming-of-age story full of bizarre encounters, gallows humor, and vivid characters (both living and very dead). Describing how she swept ashes from the machines (and sometimes onto her clothes), and cared for bodies of all shapes and sizes, Caitlin becomes an intrepid explorer in the world of the deceased. Her eye-opening memoir shows how our fear of dying warps our culture and society, and she calls for better ways of dealing with death (and our dead). In the spirit of her popular Web series, \"Ask a Mortician\", Caitlin’s engaging narrative style makes this otherwise scary topic both approachable and profound. </p> <p>Caitlin Doughty, the host and creator of the \"Ask a Mortician\" Web series and the collective Order of the Good Death, is on a mission to change the way we think about death.</p>","releaseDate":"2014-09-19","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books"}],"length":"7h 44m ","categories":[{"name":"Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development","url":"18574784011"},{"name":"Personal Development","url":"18574800011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/008090/bk_reco_008090_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51uE8pekWXL","asin":"B0753LHWHN","subHeading":"Traveling the World to Find the Good Death","title":"From Here to Eternity","authors":"Caitlin Doughty","narrators":"Caitlin Doughty","length":"5 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"41nMPIpqQ6L","asin":"1980047383","subHeading":"Big Questions from Tiny Mortals","title":"Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?","authors":"Caitlin Doughty","narrators":"Caitlin Doughty","length":"4 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51CTgo09uxL","asin":"B002V0AAEI","subHeading":"The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers","title":"Stiff","authors":"Mary Roach","narrators":"Shelly Frasier","length":"8 hrs"},{"cover":"61egBtsNiML","asin":"B00MFSB3TM","subHeading":"Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner","title":"Working Stiff","authors":"Judy Melinek MD, T.

A vicious storm killed his engine, and the current dragged his boat out to sea. The storm picked up and blasted him west. When he washed ashore on January 29, 2014, he had arrived in the Marshall Islands, 9,000 miles away - equivalent to traveling from New York to Moscow round trip. </p> <p>For 14 months, Alvarenga survived constant shark attacks. He learned to catch fish with his bare hands. He built a fish net from a pair of empty plastic bottles. Taking apart the outboard motor, he fashioned a huge fishhook. Using fish vertebrae as needles, he stitched together his own clothes. </p> <p>He considered suicide on multiple occasions - including offering himself up to a pack of sharks. But Alvarenga never failed to invent an alternative reality. He imagined a method of survival that kept his body and mind intact long enough for the Pacific Ocean to toss him up on a remote, palm-studded island, where he was saved by a local couple living alone in their own Pacific Island paradise. </p> <p>Based on dozens of hours of interviews with Alvarenga and interviews with his colleagues, search and rescue officials, the medical team that saved his life, and the remote islanders who nursed him back to health, this is an epic tale of survival, an all-true version of the fictional <i>Life of Pi</i>. <i>438 Days</i> is a study of the resilience, will, ingenuity, and determination required for one man to survive 14 months lost at sea. </p>","releaseDate":"2015-11-17","publishers":[{"name":"Simon & Schuster Audio"}],"length":"7h 7m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Adventurers, Explorers & Survival","url":"18571952011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/007285/bk_sans_007285_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51FXiL-liiL","asin":"B002V0QN4Y","subHeading":"76 Days Lost at Sea","title":"Adrift","authors":"Steven Callahan","narrators":"Steven Callahan","length":"6 hrs and 53 mins"},{"cover":"61GnxgzEsHL","asin":"B07B4GZ4P1","subHeading":"The True Story of the Most Harrowing Search and Rescue Mission Ever Attempted on Alaska's High Seas","title":"Coming Back Alive","authors":"Spike Walker","narrators":"Paul Heitsch","length":"8 hrs and 40 mins"},{"cover":"517Cl0-FWpL","asin":"B07BQX2TK5","subHeading":"Danger and Survival in the North Woods","title":"Lost in the Wild","authors":"Cary J.

In 48 lectures, you will look at what went into making our planet - from the big bang, to the formation of the solar system, to the subsequent evolution of Earth.&nbsp;</p> <p>You will travel to the center of our planet and out again, charting the geologic forces that churn beneath our feet to push the continents and seafloor around like froth on the surface of soup. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis are byproducts of our planet’s ceaseless activity, and you will focus on specific examples of each to learn why and when they occur. Volcanic activity has produced the atmosphere as a side effect, and you will learn how this sea of air functions at the global scale. Earth’s surface is mostly water, and you will explore the cycling of this vital substance throughout the planet, along with its role in climate, erosion, plate tectonics, and biology.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not only are humans at the mercy of our planet’s natural forces, but we ourselves have also become agents of change. We are altering the Earth’s land, water, and air faster than any other geologic process. This will be another theme of your journey: how humans have transformed watersheds, leveled mountains, changed the balance of gases in the atmosphere, and caused the extinction of enough species to hasten the end of the 65-million-year-old Cenozoic era. It is vitally important that we understand the nature of our geologic powers if we are to have any hope of controlling them.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>","releaseDate":"2019-03-11","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science & Engineering","url":"18580540011"},{"name":"Science","url":"18580555011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/001116/bk_tcco_001116_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51T-GTbvapL","asin":"1629976083","title":"The Theory of Everything: The Quest to Explain All Reality","authors":"Don Lincoln, The Great Courses","narrators":"Don Lincoln","length":"12 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51GnofLe1mL","asin":"1682769720","title":"Crashes and Crises: Lessons from a History of Financial Disasters","authors":"Connel Fullenkamp, The Great Courses","narrators":"Connel Fullenkamp","length":"11 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"51OYOqiPM2L","asin":"1629976644","subHeading":"How It All Works","title":"Chemistry and Our Universe","authors":"Ron B.

And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits.

Throughout the trip, we encounter fluids within the plane - from a seemingly ordinary cup of tea to a liquid crystal display screen - and without, in the volcanoes of Iceland, the frozen expanse of Greenland, and the marvelous California coastline. We come to see liquids as substances of wonder and fascination, and to understand their potential for death and destruction. Just as in <i>Stuff Matters</i>, Mark Miodownik's unique brand of scientific storytelling brings liquids and their mysterious properties to life in a captivating new way.</p>","releaseDate":"2019-02-19","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books"}],"length":"7h 16m ","categories":[{"name":"Science & Engineering","url":"18580540011"},{"name":"Science","url":"18580555011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/012802/bk_reco_012802_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41tYBiCFB8L","asin":"B07NQNQX14","subHeading":"How Plants, Powders, and Pills Have Shaped the History of Medicine","title":"Ten Drugs","authors":"Thomas Hager","narrators":"Angelo Di Loreto","length":"8 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"61C0Ve4iDPL","asin":"B07C35RV3F","subHeading":"A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes","title":"Human Errors","authors":"Nathan H.

Steve Maharidge never talked about “the good war.” On the surface, the Maharidges were a normal working-class family in the suburbs of Cleveland. But behind closed doors, even the most mundane moments could trigger Steve’s violent, traumatic episodes, which left his son Dale searching for clues to his past. And yet, there was only one: a black-and-white photograph of Steve with another soldier that hung permanently on the wall in the basement.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The Dead Drink First</i>, Dale Maharidge, now a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist, recounts his 18-year quest to learn everything he could about the man in the photo with the hopes of discovering a side of his late father he never knew. The result was something Dale never expected: Not only would he learn the man’s name - Herman Walter Mulligan - but he would help locate his remains and ultimately bring him home 74 years after he was killed in action.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this deeply personal audio documentary, Dale retraces his journey through never-before-heard conversations with WWII veterans, their children, and the team of strangers that assembled to find Mulligan and bury him on American soil. In an epic search for a lost Marine, Dale finds forgiveness, lifelong friendships, and uncovers the rich, uniquely American truth about how and why we repatriate our fallen soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Please note: </b>This story features explicit language and references to domestic abuse, violence, and war that may be upsetting to some listeners.

The first traces the rise and fall of the Comanches, the most powerful Indian tribe in American history. The second entails one of the most remarkable narratives ever to come out of the Old West: the epic saga of the pioneer woman Cynthia Ann Parker and her mixed-blood son, Quanah, who became the last and greatest chief of the Comanches.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although listeners may be more familiar with the names Apache and Sioux, it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined just how and when the American West opened up. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the Eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled <i>backward</i> by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. So effective were the Comanches that they forced the creation of the Texas Rangers and account for the advent of the new weapon specifically designed to fight them: the six-gun.&nbsp;</p> <p>The war with the Comanches lasted four decades, in effect holding up the development of the new American nation. Gwynne's exhilarating account delivers a sweeping narrative that encompasses Spanish colonialism, the Civil War, the destruction of the buffalo herds, and the arrival of the railroads - a historical feast for anyone interested in how the United States came into being.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2016-09-20","publishers":[{"name":"Simon & Schuster Audio"}],"length":"15h 9m ","categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Americas","url":"18573526011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/007623/bk_sans_007623_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51RU-740bwL","asin":"0593150953","subHeading":"In Search of a Lost Icon","title":"American Buffalo","authors":"Steven Rinella","narrators":"Steven Rinella","length":"7 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"51HVdanQ7PL","asin":"B007VQX5CG","subHeading":"The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10","title":"Lone Survivor","authors":"Marcus Luttrell, Patrick Robinson","narrators":"Kevin T.

First, there was&nbsp;combat&nbsp;in Operation&nbsp;Desert Storm as a member of SEAL Team Two. Then, the Green Course: the selection process to&nbsp;join the legendary SEAL Team Six (ST6), with a curriculum that included practiced land warfare to&nbsp;unarmed combat. More than learning how to pick a lock,&nbsp;they learned how to blow the door off its hinges. </p> <p>Finally, as member of ST6, he graduated from the most storied and challenging sniper&nbsp;program in the country:&nbsp;the Marine Corps Scout Sniper School. Eventually, of the 18 snipers in ST6, Wasdin became the best—which meant one of the best snipers on the planet. </p> <p>Less than half a year&nbsp;after sniper school,&nbsp;he was fighting for his life. The mission: capture or kill Somalian warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. From rooftops, helicopters, and alleys, Wasdin hunted Aidid and killed his men whenever possible. But everything went&nbsp;quickly to hell&nbsp;when his&nbsp;small band of soldiers found themselves fighting for their lives, cut off from help and desperately trying to rescue downed comrades during a routine mission. The Battle of Mogadishu, as it became known, left 18 American soldiers dead and 73 wounded. Howard Wasdin had both of his legs nearly blown off while engaging the enemy. His explosive combat tales and inside details&nbsp;of becoming&nbsp;one of the world’s deadliest snipers combine to make this the most thrilling and important memoir by a&nbsp;navy SEAL since <i>Lone Survivor</i>.</p>","releaseDate":"2011-05-05","publishers":[{"name":"Blackstone Audio, Inc."}],"length":"9h 35m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Military & War","url":"18571992011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/004337/bk_blak_004337_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61jsqgBB+3L","asin":"B01N6XS0HX","subHeading":"Firing the Shots That Killed Osama Bin Laden and My Years as a SEAL Team Warrior","title":"The Operator","authors":"Robert O'Neill","narrators":"Robert O'Neill","length":"9 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"5163Y83dTgL","asin":"B008HRGNM2","title":"The Red Circle: My Life in the Navy SEAL Sniper Corps and How I Trained America's Deadliest Marksmen","authors":"Brandon Webb, John David Mann","narrators":"Jon Bailey","length":"12 hrs and 40 mins"},{"cover":"51MnHNXhOML","asin":"B0092POGIG","subHeading":"The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden","title":"No Easy Day","authors":"Mark Owen, Kevin Maurer","narrators":"Holter Graham","length":"6 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"61y15lwxo0L","asin":"B01JZSJ0VW","subHeading":"A SEAL Team Three Sniper's True Account of the Battle of Ramadi","title":"The Last Punisher","authors":"Kevin Lacz, Ethan E.

It is here, under the constant threat of exploding shells and artillery, that British and German soldiers live in deplorable conditions. Braving the merciless cold and crushing exhaustion and hunger, the men conduct patrols and fight, often to the death, to advance mere inches in the frozen No Man’s Land that lies between them.</p> <p>But on Christmas Eve, the Western Front gives way to a miracle of grace, as soldiers from both sides emerge from their trenches to greet each other, share their meager rations, and bury the dead for an unofficial and temporary truce. Drawing upon the unforgettable true story of history’s most transcendent ceasefire, this Audible Original, a finalist for the 2016 Audie Award for Best Audio Drama, commemorates an astonishing moment of peace—and celebration of man’s capacity for kindness—in the midst of total war. A full cast performance of a heart-wrenching script written by Emmy Award-winner Charles Olivier and produced by Dawn Prestwich (<i>The Killing</i>), <i>Christmas Eve, 1914</i> is the perfect reminder of how holiday hope can be found in the unlikeliest of places. At the story’s end, listeners will also enjoy a performance of the classic carol, \"Il Est Ne\" by Tom Tom Club.</p> <p><i>The ensemble cast includes Damon Herriman, Cameron Daddo, Xander Berkeley, James Scott, Lance Guest, Nate Jones, Cody Fern, John Beck, Gabe Greenspan, and Heiko Obermoeller.</i><br> &nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2014-12-16","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/022326/bk_adbl_022326_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Performance","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61G5favqUtL","asin":"B0036GRN28","title":"Letters from Father Christmas","authors":"J.

(She eloped with the parson, who was, of course, penniless.) Danby suggests that at Christmastime the estate needs the presence of small children, and offers to find some - the “hirelings” - despite Sir John’s skepticism. Three children duly arrive, and the youngest, precocious four year-old Moppet, quickly endears herself to Sir John.

Irreverent, unpredictable, and leery of the sports establishment, Knight created the most muscular jock culture in business, a place where employees routinely took two hours at lunch to work out and then strategized late into the night in their holy war against competitors Reebok and Adidas. To outsiders, Nike was a cult. Insiders believed they were furthering the company's mission: to improve the performance of serious athletes. </p> <p>Not everyone could be a Nike guy. It required a certain attitude. For example: Michael Jordan refusing to wear Reebok at the 1992 Olympics, or Charles Barkley joking about becoming a porn star. In <i>Just Do It</i>, award-winning author Donald Katz shows how Nike created the spectacular imagery and marketing campaigns that made Jordan, Barkley, and Bo Jackson international icons. He also documented Nike's increasingly influential role in the management of its high-priced talent, taking us inside lucrative endorsement deals involving Jim Courier, Andre Agassi, Deion Sanders, Alonzo Mourning, and Pete Sampras as well as behind-closed-doors negotiations with the NBA and the NCAA as it considered a controversial plan for a collegiate Super Bowl brokered by Nike and super-agent Michael Ovitz. </p> <p>Nike understood the power of imagery and knew how to market those images all over the world. A truly global corporation, Nike relied on capital from Japan to manufacture shoes in Asia sold to one out of every four athletic-shoe buyers in Europe. Katz follows Nike all over the world, taking us from a 19-year-old Korean gluing shoes in a factory, to an advertising wunderkind in Oregon creating the legendary \"Bo Knows\" campaign, to the fanatical Nike kids who rush into stores the day new shoes hit the street. Along the way, Katz describes the creation and design of Nike shoes, revealing technology worthy of a James Bond movie. He examines the charges leveled against Nike: that the company is exploiting Asian peasants, corrupting younger athletes, and recklessly stirring consumer fever in urban America. He also discusses the corporate spirit and strategies that have made Nike one of the great business stories of the late 20th century. </p> <p><i>Just Do It</i> is about the business of sports and the sport of business. It is also the story of a culture in which the sight of an athlete in flight can still evoke awe. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-04-04","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Entertainment & Celebrities","url":"18571984011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/030645/bk_adbl_030645_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51pgZWQepWL","asin":"B0842XRT7P","title":"African-American Athletes Who Made History","authors":"Louis Moore, The Great Courses","narrators":"Louis Moore","length":"4 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51Di+gUJ9HL","asin":"B08DDCVRRC","title":"Thicker than Water","authors":"Tyler Shultz","narrators":"Tyler Shultz","length":"3 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"516mu-GabiL","asin":"B08DG7X16V","subHeading":"A Journey Through Lyrics & Life","title":"Bluebird Memories","authors":"Common, Awoye Timpo, NSangou Njikam","narrators":"Common","length":"1 hr and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51ll1lebmWL","asin":"B07SV4T7K7","subHeading":"An Audible Original","title":"The Space Race","authors":"Colin Brake, Patrick Chapman, Richard Hollingham, and others","narrators":"Kate Mulgrew","length":"9 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51Hhvqc6SML","asin":"B0883GHNZQ","title":"Bella Bella","authors":"Harvey Fierstein","narrators":"Harvey Fierstein","length":"1 hr and 13 mins"},{"cover":"51NK159FbkL","asin":"B089T5SW3N","title":"Dan Rather: Stories of a Lifetime","authors":"Dan Rather","narrators":"Dan Rather","length":"1 hr and 24 mins"},{"cover":"518x9ZiVZbL","asin":"B08DDC8Y8F","title":"When You Finish Saving the World","authors":"Jesse Eisenberg","narrators":"Kaitlyn Dever, Jesse Eisenberg, Finn Wolfhard","length":"5 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51YHL3AY2rL","asin":"B082MQ5TDB","title":"Phreaks","authors":"Matthew Derby","narrators":"Ben McKenzie, Carrie Coon, Christian Slater, and others","length":"5 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"51GKoszPFmL","asin":"B085F3F6CX","title":"Stuck","authors":"Chris Grabenstein","narrators":"Mark Sanderlin, Elizabeth Hess, Oliver Wyman, and others","length":"3 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51m4WyNU+hL","asin":"2291082140","title":"50 Self-Help Classics to Guide You to Financial Freedom","authors":"Napoleon Hill, George Samuel Clason, James Allen, and others","narrators":"Mark White, James Ellis, Andrew Farell, and others","length":"95 hrs and 1 min"},{"cover":"514CDvM4UoL","asin":"B07RT12V4Q","title":"Life Ever After","authors":"Carla Grauls","narrators":"Raúl Castillo, Nana Mensah, Piper Goodeve","length":"1 hr and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51sWmdvLSzL","asin":"B08DDD5V8J","subHeading":"Raising Kids During a Pandemic","title":"Childhood, Interrupted","authors":"Sanjay Gupta MD","narrators":"Dr. Sanjay Gupta","length":"46 mins"},{"cover":"513oKbpMTgL","asin":"B08DDJ56J2","title":"The Year of Magical Thinking","authors":"Joan Didion","narrators":"Vanessa Redgrave","length":"1 hr and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51mh9pHgpML","asin":"B08BDQ36W5","title":"Agent 355","authors":"Marie Benedict","narrators":"Emily Rankin","length":"2 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51UDWvzOqeL","asin":"B08C3XGN8L","subHeading":"An Audible Original Novella","title":"The Cuckoo's Cry","authors":"Caroline Overington","narrators":"Aimee Horne","length":"4 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"51Ai-zC5tnL","asin":"B07X1TGC2Z","title":"Herbie","authors":"Rich Cohen","narrators":"Rich Cohen","length":"2 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51ldTj5Q+pL","asin":"0063005352","subHeading":"Inside Nike Running and Its Culture of Deception","title":"Win at All Costs","authors":"Matt Hart","narrators":"Josh Bloomberg","length":"13 hrs and 38 mins"},{"cover":"51YbF-pykmL","asin":"B0829D7FYM","title":"History of Bourbon","authors":"Ken Albala, The Great Courses","narrators":"Ken Albala","length":"3 hrs and 55 mins"}],"added":235},{"asin":"B073H9PF2D","cover":"51RE2p8RLML","title":"Leviathan Wakes","authors":[{"name":"James S.

Now he takes us inside a sphere utterly inimical to human life. He describes navigating the extreme challenge of long-term spaceflight, both existential and banal: the devastating effects on the body; the isolation from everyone he loves and the comforts of Earth; the pressures of constant close cohabitation; the catastrophic risks of depressurization or colliding with space junk; and the still more haunting threat of being unable to help should tragedy strike at home - an agonizing situation Kelly faced when, on another mission, his twin brother's wife, Gabrielle Giffords, was shot while he still had two months in space. Kelly's humanity, compassion, humor, and passion resonate throughout as he recalls his rough-and-tumble New Jersey childhood and the youthful inspiration that sparked his astounding career and as he makes clear his belief that Mars will be the next ultimately challenging step in American spaceflight. </p> <p>A natural storyteller and modern-day hero, Kelly has a message of hope for the future that will inspire for generations to come. Here, in his personal story, we see the triumph of the human imagination, the strength of the human will, and the boundless wonder of the galaxy. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-10-17","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"length":"13h 6m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Professionals & Academics","url":"18572005011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/005095/bk_rand_005095_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51FLiQPnhnL","asin":"1649040016","subHeading":"An Insider's Guide to Leaving Planet Earth","title":"How to Astronaut","authors":"Terry Virts","narrators":"Terry Virts","length":"11 hrs and 23 mins"},{"cover":"51aCjtdxjEL","asin":"B06XYF85PN","subHeading":"An Astronaut's Story of Grit, Grace, and Second Chances","title":"Chasing Space","authors":"Leland Melvin","narrators":"Ron Butler","length":"7 hrs and 14 mins"},{"cover":"411UdMFESDL","asin":"1797102710","title":"Apollo 13","authors":"Jim Lovell, Jeffrey Kluger","narrators":"Fred Sanders","length":"16 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51TpNyiOmrL","asin":"1977348955","subHeading":"The Inside Story of America's Apollo Moon Landings","title":"Moon Shot","authors":"Alan Shepard, Deke Slayton, Jay Barbree, and others","narrators":"Christopher Grove","length":"13 hrs and 55 mins"},{"cover":"51TY88IfK2L","asin":"B0782C7L36","subHeading":"The Outrageous Tales of a Space Shuttle Astronaut","title":"Riding Rockets","authors":"Mike Mullane","narrators":"Joel Richards","length":"18 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"41bffUhJ4xL","asin":"0525633723","title":"A Promised Land","authors":"Barack Obama","narrators":"Barack Obama","length":"29 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"612Rt4fr2jL","asin":"B07CTTXLL6","subHeading":"An Informal History of Liquid Rocket Propellants","title":"Ignition!","authors":"John Drury Clark, Isaac Asimov - foreward","narrators":"Jonathan Todd Ross","length":"9 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51K89DWjQ2L","asin":"B073JFVWY1","subHeading":"The Unsung Heroes of Mission Control, 1965–1992 (Outward Odyssey: A People's History of Spaceflight)","title":"Go, Flight!","authors":"Rick Houston, J.

As a flight director in NASA's Mission Control, Kranz witnessed firsthand the making of history. He participated in the space program from the early days of the Mercury program to the last Apollo mission, and beyond. He endured the disastrous first years when rockets blew up and the United States seemed to fall further behind the Soviet Union in the space race. He helped to launch Alan Shepard and John Glenn, then assumed the flight director's role in the Gemini program, which he guided to fruition. With his teammates, he accepted the challenge to carry out President John F. Kennedy's commitment to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. </p> <p>Kranz was flight director for both Apollo 11, the mission in which Neil Armstrong fulfilled President Kennedy's pledge, and Apollo 13. He headed the Tiger Team that had to figure out how to bring the three Apollo 13 astronauts safely back to Earth. (In the film Apollo 13, Kranz was played by the actor Ed Harris, who earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance.) </p> <p> In <i>Failure Is Not an Option</i>, Gene Kranz recounts these thrilling historic events and offers new information about the famous flights. What appeared as nearly flawless missions to the moon were, in fact, a series of hair-raising near misses. When the space technology failed, as it sometimes did, the controllers' only recourse was to rely on their skills and those of their teammates. Kranz takes us inside Mission Control and introduces us to some of the whiz kids - still in their twenties, only a few years out of college - who had to figure it all out as they went along, creating a great and daring enterprise. He reveals behind-the-scenes details to demonstrate the leadership, discipline, trust, and teamwork that made the space program a success. </p>","releaseDate":"2011-08-29","publishers":[{"name":"Tantor Audio"}],"length":"18h 14m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Professionals & Academics","url":"18572005011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/002156/bk_tant_002156_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"411UdMFESDL","asin":"1797102710","title":"Apollo 13","authors":"Jim Lovell, Jeffrey Kluger","narrators":"Fred Sanders","length":"16 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51Pp5nCuseL","asin":"1977348432","subHeading":"More Than My Share of It All","title":"Kelly","authors":"Clarence L. \"Kelly\" Johnson, Maggie Smith, Brig.

Then came young adulthood, and with it a wave of doubt so strong it caused him to question everything he thought he knew about himself and the world. Ever skeptical and full of questions, Arkin embarked on a spiritual journey to find something—anything—to believe in. An existential crisis in his 30s led him to the study of Eastern philosophy. Soon he began opening himself to the possibility that there was more to life than what he had simply seen, heard, or been taught.</p> <p>In this Audible Original \"mini-memoir,\" the 84-year-old actor shares his powerful spiritual experiences, from his brush with reincarnation to the benefits of meditation. In a gruff, earthy voice that sounds more suited to a New York cabbie than a spiritual guide, he shows us that wisdom can come from the most unexpected places and teachers. <i>Out of My Mind</i> is a candid, relatable, and delightfully irreverent take on how one man went searching for meaning and ended up discovering himself.&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2018-12-06","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Entertainment & Celebrities","url":"18571984011"}],"sample":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/Audible/en_US/images/creative//B07J1G9NY9_clip1._CB1543868784_.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51cifATcw1L","asin":"B004NEPE9G","subHeading":"A Memoir","title":"An Improvised Life","authors":"Alan Arkin","narrators":"Alan Arkin","length":"4 hrs and 14 mins"},{"cover":"51vcihu8IoL","asin":"B07DKR9QK4","title":"Stories by Heart","authors":"John Lithgow, Ring Lardner, P.

But your initial instinct couldn't be further from the truth. You just haven't budgeted the right way. </p> <p><i>You Need a Budget</i> will teach you four simple rules to completely revolutionize the way you think about managing your money. With a budget, you'll break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, get out of debt, and save more money. A liberating, enabling, empowering budget will actually make you feel more free, not more restricted. The YNAB philosophy is centered around these four rules: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Give every dollar a job. Take your cash, checking, and saving accounts and assign jobs to that money. Begin now with what you have on hand. Then follow your plan. Pick your priorities, and make sure your dollars are helping you move closer to the things you care about most. </li> <li>Embrace your true expenses. Look ahead and identify the larger, less frequent expenses that tend to sneak up on you. Break those expenses into manageable monthly amounts. Consider insurance premiums, birthdays, holidays, charitable giving, car repairs, etc. This practice evens out your cash outflows, decreases your stress, and helps you make better decisions. </li> <li>Roll with the punches. Accept the fact that life always changes and you'll likely always go over budget somewhere. If an unexpected expense comes up and you need to change your budget, just change it. The YNAB philosophy not only tolerates changing your budget but encourages it. </li> <li>Age your money. The goal of this rule is to increase the time between the moment you earn money and the moment you spend that money. In other words, if you're going to break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, you need to learn to live on money you earned a month or two months or even three months ago. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>YNAB's four rules are the pillars of a tried-and-true system that gets you to engage with your money every day. It helps you change your behavior so that you're proactive and in control of your finances. It's not about stressing over last month's statement; instead, you're looking ahead and actively deciding how you want and need to build a life of meaning, not stress. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-12-26","publishers":[{"name":"HarperAudio"}],"length":"4h 54m ","categories":[{"name":"Money & Finance","url":"18574547011"},{"name":"Personal Finance","url":"18574581011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/006458/bk_harp_006458_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51iqGSp0h8L","asin":"B01B25Z6B4","subHeading":"Learn Key Strategies to Set Up a Budget, Make the Most of Your Money","title":"The 21-Day Budgeting Challenge","authors":"21 Day Challenges","narrators":"Francie Wyck","length":"1 hr and 4 mins"},{"cover":"517lVpSW+vL","asin":"B082VKHVCL","subHeading":"The Small Changes That Change Everything","title":"Tiny Habits","authors":"BJ Fogg PhD","narrators":"BJ Fogg PhD","length":"11 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51QO51sj31L","asin":"B002UUKIR8","subHeading":"A Proven Plan for Financial Fitness","title":"The Total Money Makeover","authors":"Dave Ramsey","narrators":"Dave Ramsey","length":"3 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51F+RW9S-PL","asin":"B07K7XPGRY","title":"Minimalist Budget: Simple and Practical Budgeting Strategies to Save Money, Avoid Compulsive Spending, Pay off Debt and Simplify Your Life","authors":"Marie S.

From the labs and marketing departments of big pharma to local doctor's offices; wealthy suburbs to distressed small communities in Central Appalachia; from distant cities to once-idyllic farm towns; the spread of opioid addiction follows a tortuous trajectory that illustrates how this crisis has persisted for so long and become so firmly entrenched.</p> <p>Beginning with a single dealer who lands in a small Virginia town and sets about turning high school football stars into heroin overdose statistics, Macy sets out to answer a grieving mother's question - why her only son died - and comes away with a gripping, unpausible story of greed and need. From the introduction of OxyContin in 1996, Macy investigates the powerful forces that led America's doctors and patients to embrace a medical culture where overtreatment with painkillers became the norm. In some of the same communities featured in her best-selling book <i>Factory Man</i>, the unemployed use painkillers both to numb the pain of joblessness and pay their bills, while privileged teens trade pills in cul-de-sacs, and even high school standouts fall prey to prostitution, jail, and death.</p> <p>Through unsparing, compelling, and unforgettably humane portraits of families and first responders determined to ameliorate this epidemic, each facet of the crisis comes into focus. In these politically fragmented times, Beth Macy shows that one thing uniting Americans across geographic, partisan, and class lines is opioid drug abuse. But even in the midst of twin crises in drug abuse and healthcare, Macy finds reason to hope and ample signs of the spirit and tenacity that are helping the countless ordinary people ensnared by addiction build a better future for themselves, their families, and their communities.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>\"Everyone should read Beth Macy's story of the American opioid epidemic.\" (Professor Anne C.

Millions of Americans could soon find themselves at the mercy of violent weather if the public data behind lifesaving storm alerts gets privatized for personal gain. In his first Audible Original, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author and journalist Michael Lewis delivers hard-hitting research on not-so-random weather data—and how Washington plans to release it. He also digs deep into the lives of two scientists who revolutionized climate predictions, bringing warning systems to previously unimaginable levels of accuracy.

She conjures up early operating theaters - no place for the squeamish - and surgeons, working before anesthesia, who were lauded for their speed and brute strength. These medical pioneers knew that the aftermath of surgery was often more dangerous than their patients' afflictions, and they were baffled by the persistent infections that kept mortality rates stubbornly high. At a time when surgery couldn't have been more hazardous, an unlikely figure stepped forward: a young, melancholy Quaker surgeon named Joseph Lister, who would solve the deadly riddle and change the course of history. </p> <p>Fitzharris dramatically recounts Lister's discoveries in gripping detail, culminating in his audacious claim that germs were the source of all infection - and could be countered by antiseptics. Focusing on the tumultuous period from 1850 to 1875, she introduces us to Lister and his contemporaries - some of them brilliant, some outright criminal - and takes us through the grimy medical schools and dreary hospitals where they learned their art, the deadhouses where they studied anatomy, and the graveyards they occasionally ransacked for cadavers. </p> <p>Eerie and illuminating, <i>The Butchering Art </i>celebrates the triumph of a visionary surgeon whose quest to unite science and medicine delivered us into the modern world. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-10-31","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"7h 54m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Professionals & Academics","url":"18572005011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/031254/bk_adbl_031254_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51Prg0ie-bL","asin":"B00NAAXWWA","subHeading":"A True Tale of Intrigue and Innovation at the Dawn of Modern Medicine","title":"Dr. Mutter's Marvels","authors":"Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz","narrators":"Erik Singer","length":"8 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"4117S2SOtIL","asin":"052564217X","subHeading":"And Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine","title":"The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth","authors":"Thomas Morris","narrators":"Thomas Morris, Ruper Farley","length":"9 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51Um8pRn7aL","asin":"B00VQO5R70","subHeading":"The Extraordinary Life and Times of John Hunter, Father of Modern Surgery","title":"The Knife Man","authors":"Wendy Moore","narrators":"Steve West","length":"13 hrs and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51yKVJzVZjL","asin":"1974922693","subHeading":"Filthy Palaces, Fatal Cosmetics, Deadly Medicine, and Murder Most Foul","title":"The Royal Art of Poison","authors":"Eleanor Herman","narrators":"Susie Berneis","length":"10 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"510JQOeE-JL","asin":"1250300622","subHeading":"A History of Surgery in 28 Remarkable Operations","title":"Under the Knife","authors":"Arnold van de Laar, Andy Brown - translator","narrators":"Rich Keeble","length":"9 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"61kew+CjP8L","asin":"B07DPW9MV6","subHeading":"A Brief History of the Worst Ways to Cure Everything","title":"Quackery","authors":"Lydia Kang, Nate Pedersen","narrators":"Hillary Huber","length":"10 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51rLLAWZDnL","asin":"1977349536","subHeading":"A History of Surgery","title":"Blood and Guts","authors":"Richard Hollingham","narrators":"Liam Gerrard","length":"8 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51PZqyZrP5L","asin":"B00YW0DK7E","subHeading":"What Bugs, Burns, Prints, DNA, and More Tell Us About Crime","title":"Forensics","authors":"Val McDermid","narrators":"Sarah Barron","length":"11 hrs and 20 mins"},{"cover":"61h0TKyzE8L","asin":"B01MTC3V6Y","subHeading":"History's Worst Plagues and the Heroes Who Fought Them","title":"Get Well Soon","authors":"Jennifer Wright","narrators":"Gabra Zackman","length":"7 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"61JGgAyOpqL","asin":"B01FY85DKO","subHeading":"The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life","title":"I Contain Multitudes","authors":"Ed Yong","narrators":"Charlie Anson","length":"9 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"41nMPIpqQ6L","asin":"1980047383","subHeading":"Big Questions from Tiny Mortals","title":"Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?","authors":"Caitlin Doughty","narrators":"Caitlin Doughty","length":"4 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51u04jGYW3L","asin":"B00HLPHNNE","subHeading":"The Secret Intelligence Program that Brought Nazi Scientists to America","title":"Operation Paperclip","authors":"Annie Jacobsen","narrators":"Annie Jacobsen","length":"19 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"41tYBiCFB8L","asin":"B07NQNQX14","subHeading":"How Plants, Powders, and Pills Have Shaped the History of Medicine","title":"Ten Drugs","authors":"Thomas Hager","narrators":"Angelo Di Loreto","length":"8 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"61PxV4htChL","asin":"B06ZXTMXSH","subHeading":"The Dark Story of America’s Shining Women","title":"The Radium Girls","authors":"Kate Moore","narrators":"Angela Brazil","length":"15 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51q7JH3gohL","asin":"B00XIJI13S","subHeading":"The True Story of the World's Premier Forensic Investigators","title":"No Stone Unturned","authors":"Steve Jackson","narrators":"Kevin Pierce","length":"14 hrs and 3 mins"},{"cover":"51iukkHCt1L","asin":"B01BPKQ56Q","subHeading":"The Inside Story of Our Body's Most Underrated Organ","title":"Gut","authors":"Giulia Enders","narrators":"Katy Sobey","length":"7 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"511TBFLAnYL","asin":"B01KBMP8R6","subHeading":"A Life of Ulysses S.

B. West, chief usher of the White House, directed the operations and maintenance of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - and coordinated its daily life - at the request of the president and his family. He directed state functions; planned parties, weddings, funerals, gardens, playgrounds, and extensive renovations; and with a large staff, supervised every activity in the presidential home. For 28 years, first as assistant to the chief usher, then as chief usher, he witnessed national crises and triumphs, and interacted daily with six consecutive presidents and first ladies, their parents, children and grandchildren, and houseguests - including friends, relatives, and heads of state. </p> <p>In <i>Upstairs at the White House</i>, West offers an absorbing and novel glimpse at America's first families, from the Roosevelts to the Kennedys and the Nixons. Alive with anecdotes ranging from the quotidian (Lyndon B. Johnson's showerheads) to the tragic (the aftermath of John F. Kennedy's assassination), West's audiobook is an enlightening and rich account of the American history that took place just behind the Palladian doors of the North Portico.</p>","releaseDate":"2013-10-25","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"13h 26m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Historical","url":"18571990011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/016041/bk_adbl_016041_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41AGqUTq8VL","asin":"B002V0K1J2","subHeading":"A Memoir of Growing Up Iranian in America","title":"Funny in Farsi","authors":"Firoozeh Dumas","narrators":"Firoozeh Dumas","length":"5 hrs and 40 mins"},{"cover":"41vJOR8P8UL","asin":"B007SNJMB0","subHeading":"What the Happiest People Know About Getting and Spending","title":"All the Money in the World","authors":"Laura Vanderkam","narrators":"Karen Saltus","length":"7 hrs and 23 mins"},{"cover":"51Np+DoRGKL","asin":"B00SNNUJX4","subHeading":"Inside the Private World of the White House","title":"The Residence","authors":"Kate Andersen Brower","narrators":"Karen White","length":"10 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"51xr--7FzLL","asin":"168457031X","subHeading":"The Ever Changing Role, from Martha Washington to Melania Trump","title":"First Ladies","authors":"Betty Boyd Caroli","narrators":"Susan Ericksen","length":"20 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51XF3nZWZ6L","asin":"B08R14FM2V","subHeading":"Stories from the Inside","title":"White House Usher","authors":"Christopher B.

Cold War veteran and CIA operations director Thomas Stansfield knows he must prepare his people for the next war. The rise of Islamic terrorism is coming, and it needs to be met abroad before it reaches America's shores.

Kennedy finds him in the wake of the Pan Am Lockerbie terrorist attack. Two-hundred and seventy souls perished that cold December night, and thousands of family and friends were left searching for comfort. Mitch Rapp was one of them, but he was not interested in comfort. He wanted retribution. </p> <p>Six months of intense training has prepared him to bring the war to the enemy's doorstep, and he does so with brutal efficiency. Rapp starts in Istanbul, where he assassinates the Turkish arms dealer who sold the explosives used in the Pan Am attack. Rapp then moves on to Hamburg with his team and across Europe, leaving a trail of bodies. All roads lead to Beirut, though, and what Rapp doesn't know is that the enemy is aware of his existence and has prepared a trap. The hunter is about to become the hunted, and Rapp will need every ounce of skill and cunning if he is to survive the war-ravaged city and its various terrorist factions. </p> <p>Includes the first chapter from Vince Flynn and Kyle Mills' latest thriller, <i>Enemy of the State</i>! </p>","releaseDate":"2010-10-12","publishers":[{"name":"Simon & Schuster Audio"}],"length":"11h 44m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/005227/bk_sans_005227_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61JswQpd-WL","asin":"B0071NK7KM","subHeading":"An American Assassin Thriller","title":"Kill Shot","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"10 hrs and 48 mins"},{"cover":"6199+OYjDUL","asin":"B004YLIJ04","subHeading":"Mitch Rapp Series","title":"Transfer of Power","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"Nick Sullivan","length":"16 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"51qZ4QEU+eL","asin":"B004YLIJH2","subHeading":"Mitch Rapp Series","title":"The Third Option","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"Nick Sullivan","length":"11 hrs and 45 mins"},{"cover":"51wQQHkSQxL","asin":"B004YLAC4A","subHeading":"Mitch Rapp Series","title":"Separation of Power","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"Ken Kliban","length":"13 hrs and 56 mins"},{"cover":"51FQo4JTEWL","asin":"B004VTB33E","subHeading":"Mitch Rapp Series","title":"Executive Power","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"13 hrs and 3 mins"},{"cover":"51UqwLi-NzL","asin":"B004YLIGYS","title":"Term Limits","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"Nick Sullivan","length":"15 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"51iwVH4A+OL","asin":"B004JPFTD0","title":"Memorial Day","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"13 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"61vtB8wkfuL","asin":"B002V0KCTQ","title":"Consent to Kill","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"17 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"510UeJdbGaL","asin":"B002V5CSTS","title":"Act of Treason","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"11 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"6195W6IdrJL","asin":"B002V1LAIM","subHeading":"A Thriller","title":"Extreme Measures","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"12 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"51jzuKGZ2PL","asin":"B002VA9O4U","title":"Protect and Defend","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"10 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"512GvENhSIL","asin":"B002V0RKRI","subHeading":"Mitch Rapp Series","title":"Pursuit of Honor","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"11 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51UWZeL-aTL","asin":"B009PPNDWS","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Last Man","authors":"Vince Flynn","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"11 hrs and 53 mins"},{"cover":"61WcL8rfaFL","asin":"B00WXJHXQK","title":"The Survivor","authors":"Vince Flynn, Kyle Mills","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"10 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"61IGHtXQQsL","asin":"B072F77W4D","subHeading":"A Mitch Rapp Novel, Book 16","title":"Enemy of the State","authors":"Vince Flynn, Kyle Mills","narrators":"Scott Brick","length":"11 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"51RZ6k5tI8L","asin":"B079VPVBSW","subHeading":"A Mitch Rapp Novel, Book 17","title":"Red War","authors":"Vince Flynn, Kyle Mills","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"9 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"61mREjEwIUL","asin":"B01FCY3W12","subHeading":"Mitch Rapp Series","title":"Order to Kill","authors":"Vince Flynn, Kyle Mills","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"9 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"51qcgHKHGXL","asin":"1508287716","subHeading":"A Mitch Rapp Novel, Book 18","title":"Lethal Agent","authors":"Vince Flynn, Kyle Mills","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"9 hrs and 49 mins"}],"added":191},{"asin":"B07CK8P7B4","cover":"51MAfdGrKDL","title":"Deep Shadow: The Deep Series, Book 1","authors":[{"name":"Nick Sullivan","url":"B01IJ584FA"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Nick Sullivan"}],"series":[{"name":"The Deep","asin":"B07QXXDD6X","bookNumbers":["1"]}],"blurb":"Scuba divers travel from all over the world to visit the little island of Bonaire, with its crystal clear waters and beautiful marine life.

This dire situation is made worse when Tom attacks again - and is killed. Driven mad by a rare reaction to extended cryo-sleep, Tom hacked the <i>Galahad</i>'s navigation system and locked the ship on a faster-than-light journey through the universe, destination: nowhere. Ever. </p> <p>Mysteriously immortal, William is taken on a journey with no end, where he encounters solitary desperation, strange and violent lifeforms, a forbidden love, and the nature of reality itself. </p> <p><b>...he discovers the infinite.</b> </p> <p><b>Jeremy Robinson, the master of fast-paced and highly original stories seamlessly blending elements of horror, science fiction, and thrillers, tackles his most ambitious subject matter to date: reality itself. An amalgam of the works of J.J. Abrams and Ridley Scott, <i>Infinite </i>is a bold science fiction novel exploring the vastness of space and a man's desire to exist, find love, and alter the course of his life.</b> </p>","releaseDate":"2017-10-20","publishers":[{"name":"Breakneck Media"}],"length":"10h 21m ","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/acx0/099341/bk_acx0_099341_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"516ZLprWeJL","asin":"B08WR1M9PL","title":"Infinite 2","authors":"Jeremy Robinson","narrators":"R.C.

Nye believes we'll never be able to tackle our society's biggest, most complex problems if we don't even know how to solve the small ones. Step by step, he shows his listeners the key tools behind his everything-all-at-once approach: radical curiosity, a deep desire for a better future, and a willingness to take the actions needed to make it a reality. Problem solving is a skill that anyone can harness to create change, and Bill Nye is here to teach us how. </p> <p>Each chapter describes a principle of problem solving that Nye himself uses - methodical, fact-based approaches to life that aspires to leave no stone unturned. He explains how the nerd mindset leads to a richer and more meaningful life; far more than that, it can help address hunger, crime, poverty, pollution, and even assist the democratic process. Throughout the book, Nye draws on his own experiences - leavened with his trademark humor and self-deprecation - to show how he came to think like a Science Guy, and how you can, too. By the end you will be ready to sort out problems, recognize solutions, and join him in changing the world. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-07-11","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books, Inc."}],"length":"12h 34m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Professionals & Academics","url":"18572005011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/010066/bk_reco_010066_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51D4so0aSbL","asin":"B014LKFHYS","subHeading":"Harnessing Science to Change the World","title":"Unstoppable","authors":"Bill Nye","narrators":"Bill Nye","length":"11 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51PVAIw27sL","asin":"B00NB5ED3G","subHeading":"Evolution and the Science of Creation","title":"Undeniable","authors":"Bill Nye","narrators":"Bill Nye","length":"9 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51CD6MLuGZL","asin":"B00DG7RDJA","title":"Argumentation: The Study of Effective Reasoning, 2nd Edition","authors":"David Zarefsky, The Great Courses","narrators":"David Zarefsky","length":"12 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"5119ajPcFtL","asin":"B06WP73N5W","subHeading":"Why Are We Here?","title":"The Greatest Story Ever Told - So Far","authors":"Lawrence M.

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. In <i>The Sixth Extinction</i>, two-time winner of the <i>National Magazine Award</i> and <i>New Yorker</i> writer Elizabeth Kolbert draws on the work of scores of researchers in half a dozen disciplines, accompanying many of them into the field: geologists who study deep ocean cores, botanists who follow the tree line as it climbs up the Andes, marine biologists who dive off the Great Barrier Reef. </p> <p>She introduces us to a dozen species, some already gone, others facing extinction, including the Panamian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the Sumatran rhino. Through these stories, Kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as concept, from its first articulation by Georges Cuvier in revolutionary Paris up through the present day. The sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy; as Kolbert observes, it compels us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.</p>","releaseDate":"2014-02-11","publishers":[{"name":"Simon & Schuster Audio"}],"length":"9h 59m ","categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"World","url":"18573695011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/006545/bk_sans_006545_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51P6A0bssRL","asin":"150825527X","subHeading":"The Nature of the Future","title":"Under a White Sky","authors":"Elizabeth Kolbert","narrators":"Rebecca Lowman","length":"6 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"41GOU8EWdBL","asin":"0593103068","subHeading":"Life After Warming","title":"The Uninhabitable Earth","authors":"David Wallace-Wells","narrators":"David Wallace-Wells","length":"9 hrs"},{"cover":"51gJim9VwGL","asin":"B002V8MJPS","subHeading":"Man, Nature, and Climate Change","title":"Field Notes from a Catastrophe","authors":"Elizabeth Kolbert","narrators":"Hope Davis","length":"4 hrs and 56 mins"},{"cover":"51lTQ3M0k-L","asin":"0593215753","subHeading":"The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need","title":"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster","authors":"Bill Gates","narrators":"Wil Wheaton, Bill Gates","length":"7 hrs and 11 mins"},{"cover":"61QiN50pSAL","asin":"B016AWANSA","title":"The Sixth Extinction, by Elizabeth Kolbert: Key Takeaways, Analysis, & Review","authors":"Instaread","narrators":"Michael Gilboe","length":"25 mins"},{"cover":"51H0ZsQfsKL","asin":"179711705X","subHeading":"Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race","title":"The Code Breaker","authors":"Walter Isaacson","narrators":"Kathe Mazur, Walter Isaacson","length":"16 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"51ekTEdFG-L","asin":"B00M9J1VV2","subHeading":"Capitalism vs. the Climate","title":"This Changes Everything","authors":"Naomi Klein","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"20 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"61F+uGlkIcL","asin":"B06Y45MPGC","subHeading":"Volcanic Apocalypses, Lethal Oceans, and Our Quest to Understand Earth's Past Mass Extinctions","title":"The Ends of the World","authors":"Peter Brannen","narrators":"Adam Verner","length":"9 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"514aCl5EigL","asin":"B07775S2TG","subHeading":"Translated by Martin McLaughlin, Tim Parks, & William Weaver","title":"The Complete Cosmicomics","authors":"Italo Calvino, Martin McLaughlin - translator, Tim Parks - translator, and others","narrators":"Jefferson Mays","length":"15 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"51WJhBiWF4L","asin":"B0036LR2Z6","title":"Silent Spring","authors":"Rachel Carson","narrators":"Kaiulani Lee","length":"10 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"61GQlqBcOGL","asin":"B076Q3N79Q","subHeading":"Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, and the Remaking of the Civilized World","title":"The Water Will Come","authors":"Jeff Goodell","narrators":"Ian Ferguson","length":"9 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"51Oi+FcrkKL","asin":"B004G7VN04","subHeading":"The Fate of Human Societies","title":"Guns, Germs and Steel","authors":"Jared Diamond","narrators":"Doug Ordunio","length":"16 hrs and 20 mins"},{"cover":"51w91OtVoUL","asin":"B07L17R5BH","title":"What We Know About Climate Change: Updated with a new foreword by Bob Inglis (The MIT Press)","authors":"Kerry Emanuel, Bob Inglis - foreword","narrators":"Karen Chilton","length":"1 hr and 47 mins"},{"cover":"51nn0wFre-L","asin":"B002V5GMRC","title":"The World Without Us","authors":"Alan Weisman","narrators":"Adam Grupper","length":"12 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"61RpeuQmXpL","asin":"B071VQ7K5Q","subHeading":"The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming","title":"Drawdown","authors":"Paul Hawken","narrators":"Christopher Solimene","length":"18 hrs and 53 mins"},{"cover":"512rzuss8lL","asin":"B01KTWQKTS","subHeading":"New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","title":"1491","authors":"Charles C.

It chronicles their careers over nearly three decades as they faced challenges, forged alliances, and used their intellects to change their own lives - and their country's future.&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2016-09-06","publishers":[{"name":"HarperAudio"}],"length":"10h 47m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Cultural, Ethnic & Regional","url":"18571958011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/005487/bk_harp_005487_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"517HEqShwEL","asin":"B01M0M4K41","title":"Hidden Figures Young Readers' Edition","authors":"Margot Lee Shetterly","narrators":"Bahni Turpin","length":"4 hrs and 11 mins"},{"cover":"51qCH5IOuGL","asin":"B075QPGYYH","subHeading":"The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II","title":"Code Girls","authors":"Liza Mundy","narrators":"Erin Bennett","length":"14 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"617imZ75zSL","asin":"B002UZKYDQ","title":"The Help","authors":"Kathryn Stockett","narrators":"Jenna Lamia, Bahni Turpin, Octavia Spencer, and others","length":"18 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"51OOrtrVLqL","asin":"B01DMYC6KM","subHeading":"The Women Who Propelled Us, from Missiles to the Moon to Mars","title":"Rise of the Rocket Girls","authors":"Nathalia Holt","narrators":"Erin Bennett","length":"9 hrs and 45 mins"},{"cover":"516fyEKW03L","asin":"B00F9F8K8K","subHeading":"How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World","title":"I Am Malala","authors":"Malala Yousafzai, Christina Lamb - contributor","narrators":"Archie Panjabi","length":"9 hrs and 55 mins"},{"cover":"41q1+n-yzdL","asin":"B01DDZ3JG0","subHeading":"Notes from a Loud Woman","title":"Shrill","authors":"Lindy West","narrators":"Lindy West","length":"6 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"41DMscDng8L","asin":"B00HUW3DTQ","subHeading":"The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder","title":"Thrive","authors":"Arianna Huffington","narrators":"Agapi Stassinopoulos","length":"9 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"61PxV4htChL","asin":"B06ZXTMXSH","subHeading":"The Dark Story of America’s Shining Women","title":"The Radium Girls","authors":"Kate Moore","narrators":"Angela Brazil","length":"15 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"41z4tCJCa7L","asin":"B07FTSJVTB","subHeading":"An American Journey","title":"The Truths We Hold","authors":"Kamala Harris","narrators":"Kamala Harris","length":"9 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"51aR-6DndZL","asin":"1508297711","subHeading":"The Autobiography of NASA Mathematician Katherine Johnson","title":"Reaching for the Moon","authors":"Katherine Johnson","narrators":"Heather Alicia Simms","length":"5 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"41iNHcxiBtL","asin":"0062967606","subHeading":"How to Break Free and Succeed as You Are","title":"The Likeability Trap","authors":"Alicia Menendez","narrators":"Alicia Menendez","length":"6 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"51uegWJWIoL","asin":"B077BVXQ4D","subHeading":"How to Build Your Future and Make Real Change","title":"Lead from the Outside","authors":"Stacey Abrams","narrators":"Stacey Abrams","length":"7 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51r+9ZmgdBL","asin":"0062801368","subHeading":"Finding God in the Faith of Others","title":"Holy Envy","authors":"Barbara Brown Taylor","narrators":"Hillary Huber","length":"7 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"41bffUhJ4xL","asin":"0525633723","title":"A Promised Land","authors":"Barack Obama","narrators":"Barack Obama","length":"29 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"61M9eJSTNtL","asin":"B075K5P8HR","subHeading":"A True Story of Love, Spies, and the Unlikely Heroine who Outwitted America's Enemies","title":"The Woman Who Smashed Codes","authors":"Jason Fagone","narrators":"Cassandra Campbell","length":"13 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51NwvTgdAYL","asin":"B01K3KUJ5C","title":"My Own Words","authors":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Mary Hartnett, Wendy W.

This time she may have met her match. In Kenya, an Ebola-like pathogen has infected two Americans. One lies at death's door. With the clock ticking, Peyton assembles her team and joins personnel from the Kenyan Ministry of Health and the WHO. What they find in the remote village is beyond their worst fears.

To his shock and horror, he learns that he may be involved in causing the outbreak - and could hold the only key to stopping it. </p> <p>As the pathogen spreads around the world, Peyton and Desmond race to unravel the conspiracy behind the pandemic - and uncover secrets some want to keep buried. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-06-20","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"18h 53m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574621011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/025006/bk_adbl_025006_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51FzfwOgKgL","asin":"1980033153","title":"The Lost Colony","authors":"A.G.

It's sort of about porn, but it's about a lot of other things. It's sad, funny, moving and totally unlike some other nonfiction stories about porn - because it isn't judgmental or salacious. It's human and sweet and strange and lovely. It's a mystery story, an adventure. It's also, I think, a new way of telling a story. This season follows a single butterfly effect. The flap of the butterfly’s wings is a boy in Brussels having an idea. His idea is how to get rich from giving the world free online porn. Over seven episodes I trace the consequences of this idea, from consequence through to consequence. If you keep going in this way, where might you end up? It turns out you end up in the most surprising and unexpected places. </i></p> <p><i>So if you're thinking, why do I want to listen to a show about the tech takeover of the porn industry, I have two things to say: </i></p> <p><i>1. Why wouldn't you want to listen to a show about the tech takeover of the porn industry? That's a great idea for a show. </i></p> <p><i>2. Would you want to listen to a show about three women destroying a mysterious Norwegian man's stamp collection? Well, that happens at the end of episode 2. At the end of Episode 3 a woman becomes convinced that she played a part in a murder committed by an Italian priest. At the end of Episode 4 a boy in Oklahoma is forced to move to a house on the very, very edge of his town. </i></p> <p><i>I hope you like our show, </i></p> <p><i>Jon Ronson</i> </p>","releaseDate":"2017-07-27","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"length":"3h 25m ","categories":null,"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/a071/000005/or_a071_000005_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Radio/TV Program","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51XW8b1aDrL","asin":"B07JK61MK3","title":"The Last Days of August","authors":"Jon Ronson","narrators":"Jon Ronson","length":"3 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"51hwP9X0oSL","asin":"B009L8EMRE","title":"Lost at Sea: The Jon Ronson Mysteries","authors":"Jon Ronson","narrators":"Jon Ronson","length":"15 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"61OW2syCGiL","asin":"B00507AXAA","subHeading":"A Journey Through the Madness Industry","title":"The Psychopath Test","authors":"Jon Ronson","narrators":"Jon Ronson","length":"7 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"51Hw034TB9L","asin":"B01M7O0HG9","subHeading":"A Journey into the Trump Campaign and the \"Alt-Right\"","title":"The Elephant in the Room","authors":"Jon Ronson","narrators":"Jon Ronson","length":"1 hr and 47 mins"},{"cover":"51HNdSj1sUL","asin":"B01FYDBL0A","title":"The Men Who Stare at Goats","authors":"Jon Ronson","narrators":"Jon Ronson","length":"6 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51WqfIBhaTL","asin":"B009AFT0E8","title":"Them: Adventures with Extremists","authors":"Jon Ronson","narrators":"Jon Ronson","length":"8 hrs and 16 mins"}],"added":135},{"asin":"B01B8I56K6","cover":"616meZSdi8L","title":"Old Money: A Jake Crosby Thriller, Book 3","authors":[{"name":"Bobby Cole","url":"B001LHTV2O"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Jeremy Arthur"}],"series":[{"name":"Jake Crosby","asin":"B00AWWIR4M","bookNumbers":["3"]}],"blurb":"Jake Crosby has traded in a stockbroker's suit and tie for a standard-issue uniform.

Spurred by a public outcry, the federal government launched an epic two-year manhunt for the site's elusive proprietor, with no leads, no witnesses, and no clear jurisdiction. All the investigators knew was that whoever was running the site called himself the Dread Pirate Roberts. </p> <p>The Silk Road quickly ballooned into a $1.2 billion enterprise, and Ross embraced his new role as kingpin. He enlisted a loyal crew of allies in high and low places, all as addicted to the danger and thrill of running an illegal marketplace as their customers were to the heroin they sold. Through his network he got wind of the target on his back and took drastic steps to protect himself - including ordering a hit on a former employee. As Ross made plans to disappear forever, the feds raced against the clock to catch a man they weren't sure even existed, searching for a needle in the haystack of the global Internet. </p> <p>Drawing on exclusive access to key players and two billion digital words and images Ross left behind, <i>Vanity Fair</i> correspondent and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Nick Bilton offers a tale filled with twists and turns, lucky breaks, and unbelievable close calls. It's a story of the boy next door's ambition gone criminal, spurred on by the clash between the new world of libertarian-leaning, anonymous, decentralized web advocates and the old world of government control, order, and the rule of law. Filled with unforgettable characters and capped by an astonishing climax, <i>American Kingpin</i> might be dismissed as too outrageous for fiction.

Save for one thing: The Civil War never occurred. </b> </p> <p>A gifted young black man calling himself Victor has struck a bargain with federal law enforcement, working as a bounty hunter for the US Marshal Service. He's got plenty of work. In this version of America, slavery continues in four states called \"the Hard Four\". On the trail of a runaway known as Jackdaw, Victor arrives in Indianapolis knowing that something isn't right - with the case file, with his work, and with the country itself. </p> <p>A mystery to himself, Victor suppresses his memories of his childhood on a plantation and works to infiltrate the local cell of an abolitionist movement called the Underground Airlines. Tracking Jackdaw through the back rooms of churches, empty parking garages, hotels, and medical offices, Victor believes he's hot on the trail. But his strange, increasingly uncanny pursuit is complicated by a boss who won't reveal the extraordinary stakes of Jackdaw's case as well as by a heartbreaking young woman and her child, who may be Victor's salvation. Victor himself may be the biggest obstacle of all - though his true self remains buried, it threatens to surface. </p> <p>Victor believes himself to be a good man doing bad work, unwilling to give up the freedom he has worked so hard to earn.

Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius' life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits. </p> <p>Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: Can the nation of inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk - one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history - is a contemporary, visionary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists, including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy. </p>","releaseDate":"2015-05-19","publishers":[{"name":"HarperAudio"}],"length":"13h 23m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Professionals & Academics","url":"18572005011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/004473/bk_harp_004473_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51S2iJN3DYL","asin":"B005V0QI82","title":"Steve Jobs","authors":"Walter Isaacson","narrators":"Dylan Baker","length":"25 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51xsrfKEHaL","asin":"B079J6K1TD","title":"The Most Productive People in History: 18 Extraordinarily Prolific Inventors, Artists, and Entrepreneurs, from Archimedes to Elon Musk","authors":"Michael Rank","narrators":"Kevin Meyer","length":"5 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"51DZeZw7K0L","asin":"0593294181","title":"Greenlights","authors":"Matthew McConaughey","narrators":"Matthew McConaughey","length":"6 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"51ULBoVSTcL","asin":"B00FJJFO1C","subHeading":"Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon","title":"The Everything Store","authors":"Brad Stone","narrators":"Pete Larkin","length":"13 hrs"},{"cover":"51HiU+5mTwL","asin":"B01D24NLWO","subHeading":"The Computer Science of Human Decisions","title":"Algorithms to Live By","authors":"Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths","narrators":"Brian Christian","length":"11 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"51u2TAyAUmL","asin":"B002V01IXA","subHeading":"Warren Buffett and the Business of Life","title":"The Snowball","authors":"Alice Schroeder","narrators":"Kirsten Potter","length":"36 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"51a3GQYQRbL","asin":"B073W8T1CX","title":"Elon Musk.

A hysterical, ridiculous book about crippling depression and anxiety? That sounds like a <i>terrible</i> idea.&nbsp;</p> <p>But terrible ideas are what Jenny does best.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Jenny says:&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Some people might think that being 'furiously happy' is just an excuse to be stupid and irresponsible and invite a herd of kangaroos over to your house without telling your husband first because you suspect he would say no since he's never particularly liked kangaroos. And that would be ridiculous because no one would invite a herd of kangaroos into their house. Two is the limit. I speak from personal experience. My husband says that none is the new limit. I say he should have been clearer about that before I rented all those kangaroos.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Most of my favorite people are dangerously f--ked-up but you'd never guess because we've learned to bare it so honestly that it becomes the new normal. Like John Hughes wrote in The Breakfast Club, 'We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it.' Except go back and cross out the word 'hiding.'\"&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Furiously Happy</i> is about \"taking those moments when things are fine and making them amazing, because those moments are what make us who we are, and they're the same moments we take into battle with us when our brains declare war on our very existence. It's the difference between 'surviving life' and 'living life'. It's the difference between 'taking a shower' and 'teaching your monkey butler how to shampoo your hair'. It's the difference between being 'sane' and being 'furiously happy.'\"</p> <p>Lawson is beloved around the world for her inimitable humor and honesty, and in <i>Furiously Happy</i>, she is at her snort-inducing funniest. This is a book about embracing everything that makes us who we are - the beautiful and the flawed - and then using it to find joy in fantastic and outrageous ways. Because as Jenny's mom says, \"Maybe 'crazy' isn't so bad after all.\" Sometimes crazy is just right.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The audiobook contains a bonus chapter only available to listeners. </b></p>","releaseDate":"2015-09-22","publishers":[{"name":"Macmillan Audio"}],"length":"8h 28m ","categories":[{"name":"Health & Wellness","url":"18573370011"},{"name":"Psychology & Mental Health","url":"18573475011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/aren/001960/bk_aren_001960_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51hPJ13AsDL","asin":"B007T7U0RK","subHeading":"A Mostly True Memoir","title":"Let's Pretend This Never Happened","authors":"Jenny Lawson","narrators":"Jenny Lawson","length":"8 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51BqUV0hxoL","asin":"125079093X","title":"Broken (in the Best Possible Way)","authors":"Jenny Lawson","narrators":"Jenny Lawson","length":"8 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51A5N2fRPGL","asin":"1524853984","subHeading":"One Introvert's Year of Saying Yes","title":"Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come","authors":"Jessica Pan","narrators":"Jessica Pan","length":"8 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51NShr5s2LL","asin":"B071VRPFB1","subHeading":"Essays","title":"We Are Never Meeting in Real Life","authors":"Samantha Irby","narrators":"Samantha Irby","length":"9 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"516DZ2r5m9L","asin":"1515949834","subHeading":"Competitive Crafters, Drop-Off Despots, and Other Suburban Scourges","title":"People I Want to Punch in the Throat","authors":"Jen Mann","narrators":"Jen Mann","length":"5 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"51KrBjE9ajL","asin":"B07NLL95S4","subHeading":"A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed","title":"Maybe You Should Talk to Someone","authors":"Lori Gottlieb","narrators":"Brittany Pressley","length":"14 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"41q1+n-yzdL","asin":"B01DDZ3JG0","subHeading":"Notes from a Loud Woman","title":"Shrill","authors":"Lindy West","narrators":"Lindy West","length":"6 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"512QYi8RoLL","asin":"B00MP15T12","title":"Yes Please","authors":"Amy Poehler","narrators":"Amy Poehler, Carol Burnett, Seth Meyers, and others","length":"7 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"51WhLuOA-ML","asin":"059334023X","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Midnight Library","authors":"Matt Haig","narrators":"Carey Mulligan","length":"8 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"51DZeZw7K0L","asin":"0593294181","title":"Greenlights","authors":"Matthew McConaughey","narrators":"Matthew McConaughey","length":"6 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"51y1DaT8pQL","asin":"B004RCBFII","title":"Bossypants","authors":"Tina Fey","narrators":"Tina Fey","length":"5 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"41uaH6isKoL","asin":"B07BGGTGBQ","title":"Calypso","authors":"David Sedaris","narrators":"David Sedaris","length":"6 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"51CmDz8fSfL","asin":"1545914729","subHeading":"The Messy Truth About Motherhood","title":"Mom Babble","authors":"Mary Katherine Backstrom, Meredith Masony - foreword","narrators":"Mary Katherine Backstrom","length":"3 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"51ltsE6uaNL","asin":"B017BZP0VK","subHeading":"Key Takeaways, Analysis & Review","title":"Furiously Happy: A Funny Book About Horrible Things, by Jenny Lawson","authors":"Instaread","narrators":"Michael Gilboe","length":"21 mins"},{"cover":"51inIyozpuL","asin":"B00D48KE4W","subHeading":"Memoir of a Strange Girl","title":"Loud in the House of Myself","authors":"Stacy Pershall","narrators":"Stacy Pershall","length":"6 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51B0QB1L5FL","asin":"B076T8CXXV","subHeading":"The Genius and the Absurdity","title":"Girl Logic","authors":"Iliza Shlesinger","narrators":"Mayim Bialik, Iliza Shlesinger","length":"5 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"51oMNv-cyeL","asin":"B07DX9W2CG","subHeading":"How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead","title":"Daring Greatly","authors":"Brené Brown","narrators":"Brené Brown","length":"6 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"619oSCZc3+L","asin":"B074THMLX4","subHeading":"Remembering & Reigniting Our Sacred Dreams","title":"The Awakened Woman","authors":"Tererai Trent PhD","narrators":"Tererai Trent PhD","length":"11 hrs and 27 mins"}],"added":94},{"asin":"B00JFF4WMS","cover":"41zRrzqD1fL","title":"The Girl with All the Gifts","authors":[{"name":"M.

Let's keep that between us.\" (Narrator Nick Offerman) </p> <p>With <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>, not even Twain could have known that when he introduced readers to the inhabitants of the fictional town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, he would also be introducing two characters - one a clever and mischievous scamp, and the other a carefree, innocent ragamuffin - whose stories would ultimately shape the course of American literature. But whereas its sequel and companion piece, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, would harken an end to childhood, the story of Tom Sawyer is one that depicts the excitement and adventure of boyhood along the Mississippi. </p> <p>Revisit this enduring classic and you will be struck not only by Twain's skill at capturing a time and place so vividly but also by his uncanny ability to crystallize those oftentimes tumultuous and conflicting emotions that a child experiences at the precipice of adulthood: a longing to be free from the rules and obligations of adults while enjoying the laxity inherent in childhood; a love of all things macabre, like blood oaths, cemetery cures, and haunted houses, that reveal a true innocence - an unawareness of real-life consequences and one's own mortality; and the pangs of guilt when knowing the right thing to do and doing the right thing appear to be at odds. </p> <p>A natural storyteller and raconteur in his own right - just listen to <i>Paddle Your Own Canoe</i> and <i>Gumption</i> - actor, comedian, carpenter, and all-around manly man Nick Offerman (<i>Parks and Recreation</i>) brings his distinctive baritone and a fine-tuned comic versatility to Twain's writing. In a knockout performance, he doesn't so much as read Twain's words as he does rejoice in them, delighting in the hijinks of Tom - whom he lovingly refers to as a \"great scam artist\" and \"true American hero\" - while deftly delivering the tenderness and care Twain gave to his own characters. </p>","releaseDate":"2016-09-20","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"7h 52m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/023718/bk_adbl_023718_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"517qEjjMXyL","asin":"B0040J17CW","title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: A Signature Performance by Elijah Wood","authors":"Mark Twain","narrators":"Elijah Wood","length":"10 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"61QfvsUrkJL","asin":"1982741627","title":"The Complete Tom Sawyer & Huckleberry Finn Collection","authors":"Mark Twain","narrators":"Henry Adams","length":"21 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"518gVgBTGpL","asin":"B07V2C16FC","subHeading":"Weirdbey Island, Book 1","title":"The Pirates of Penn Cove","authors":"Eldritch Black","narrators":"J.

In the mountains above Johnstown, an old earth dam had been hastily rebuilt to create a lake for an exclusive summer resort patronized by the tycoons of that same industrial prosperity, among them Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Andrew Mellon. Despite repeated warnings of possible danger, nothing was done about the dam. Then came May 31, 1889, when the dam burst, sending a wall of water thundering down the mountain, smashing through Johnstown, and killing more than 2,000 people. It was a tragedy that became a national scandal. <p> Graced by David McCullough's remarkable gift for writing richly textured, sympathetic social history, <i>The Johnstown Flood</i> is an absorbing portrait of life in 19th-century America, of overweening confidence, of energy, and of tragedy. This is a powerful historical lesson for our century and all times: the danger of assuming that because people are in positions of responsibility they are behaving responsibly.</p>","releaseDate":"2005-06-17","publishers":[{"name":"Simon & Schuster Audio"}],"length":"9h 3m ","categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Americas","url":"18573526011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/000588/bk_sans_000588_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51cwZdhaC7L","asin":"B0080JBGZQ","subHeading":"The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge","title":"The Great Bridge","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"Nelson Runger","length":"27 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"61KDJFh71OL","asin":"B014I52NU2","subHeading":"Portraits in History","title":"Brave Companions","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"David McCullough","length":"11 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"61r2UxW8h5L","asin":"B004KO0Z6Q","subHeading":"The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","title":"The Path Between the Seas","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"Nelson Runger","length":"31 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"515EjXI21kL","asin":"B00TA5BJ4W","title":"The Wright Brothers","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"David McCullough","length":"10 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"51eKjf32QKL","asin":"B004JOZSQ4","title":"Mornings on Horseback","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"Nelson Runger","length":"19 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"61-kEDNmI6L","asin":"B004ZL2STG","subHeading":"Americans in Paris","title":"The Greater Journey","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"Edward Herrmann","length":"16 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"51GcnSeKopL","asin":"B004W1ROSY","title":"Truman","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"Nelson Runger","length":"54 hrs and 11 mins"},{"cover":"51tAmoigKnL","asin":"B002V8KSTW","title":"1776","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"David McCullough","length":"11 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"51eOvofPocL","asin":"0593163540","subHeading":"A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History","title":"Isaac's Storm","authors":"Erik Larson","narrators":"Richard Davidson","length":"8 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51ozDAtqjzL","asin":"B002V0K52K","title":"The Course of Human Events","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"David McCullough","length":"37 mins"},{"cover":"61cHf8fOqKL","asin":"B002VACOB0","title":"John Adams","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"Nelson Runger","length":"29 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"51bSm9vIzeL","asin":"B06XDFHR7S","subHeading":"Who We Are and What We Stand For","title":"The American Spirit","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"David McCullough","length":"4 hrs and 13 mins"},{"cover":"41YZGRy1Z-L","asin":"B002V8MKHA","title":"Thunderstruck","authors":"Erik Larson","narrators":"Bob Balaban","length":"11 hrs and 56 mins"},{"cover":"51i0I2TGMgL","asin":"B004WPQ3V4","subHeading":"Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin","title":"In the Garden of Beasts","authors":"Erik Larson","narrators":"Stephen Hoye","length":"12 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51Y3Tp1Tl4L","asin":"B00GMPFAY8","subHeading":"The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919","title":"Dark Tide","authors":"Stephen Puleo","narrators":"Grover Gardner","length":"9 hrs and 23 mins"},{"cover":"51E1sRrD86L","asin":"B01F2LI616","title":"The Children's Blizzard","authors":"David Laskin","narrators":"Paul Woodson","length":"9 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"51MjkI4H9WL","asin":"B002V5H10Y","subHeading":"The Day the World Exploded, August 27, 1883","title":"Krakatoa","authors":"Simon Winchester","narrators":"Simon Winchester","length":"12 hrs and 1 min"},{"cover":"51iqOe-wogL","asin":"B002V8N7AE","subHeading":"The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America","title":"Rising Tide","authors":"John M.

Sure, the life he's chosen isn't much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he's content with his quiet and peaceful existence. That is until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve. </p> <p>Far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to \"fold\" dimensions, it shrinks distances so a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. The invention promises to make mankind's dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the door is completely safe. Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn't quite what it seems - and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret. </p> <p>As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there's only one answer that makes sense. And if he's right, it may be only a matter of time before the project destroys...everything.

Labeled variously a realistic story of whaling, a romance of unusual adventure and eccentric characters, a symbolic allegory, and a drama of heroic conflict, <i>Moby Dick</i> is first and foremost a great story. It has both the humor and poignancy of a simple sea ballad, as well as the depth and universality of a grand odyssey. <p>When Melville's father died in 1832, the young man's financial security went too. For a while he turned to school-mastering and clerking, but failed to make a sustainable income. In 1840 he signed up on the whaler, Acushnet, out of New Bedford, Massachusetts. He was just 21. A whaler's life turned out to be both arduous and dangerous, and in 1842, Melville deserted ship. Out of this experience and a wealth of printed sources, Melville crafted his masterpiece.</p>","releaseDate":"2008-10-27","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/002104/bk_reco_002104_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"611Eot7+zJL","asin":"B005GFQ5WQ","title":"The Count of Monte Cristo","authors":"Alexandre Dumas","narrators":"Bill Homewood","length":"52 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51Ecc++n0tL","asin":"B002V08IYW","title":"A Tale of Two Cities [Tantor]","authors":"Charles Dickens","narrators":"Simon Vance","length":"13 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"51DPtqRWnYL","asin":"B004VMD7BW","title":"The Grapes of Wrath","authors":"John Steinbeck, Robert DeMott","narrators":"Dylan Baker","length":"21 hrs and 1 min"},{"cover":"61f8oxmdSWL","asin":"B005ZIMPJG","title":"Great Expectations","authors":"Charles Dickens","narrators":"Simon Prebble","length":"18 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"41eJL8JMI2L","asin":"B009XEJWP8","subHeading":"Translated by Edith Grossman","title":"Don Quixote","authors":"Miguel de Cervantes, Edith Grossman (translator)","narrators":"George Guidall","length":"39 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51WbIWV9PSL","asin":"B002V8L4X6","title":"Ulysses","authors":"James Joyce","narrators":"Jim Norton","length":"27 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"51Uorf8f+3L","asin":"B00BWYDMK8","title":"The Great Gatsby","authors":"F.

Longer training, ever more advanced technologies - neither seems to prevent grievous errors. But in a hopeful turn, acclaimed surgeon and writer Atul Gawande finds a remedy in the humblest and simplest of techniques: the checklist. First introduced decades ago by the US Air Force, checklists have enabled pilots to fly aircraft of mind-boggling sophistication. Now innovative checklists are being adopted in hospitals around the world, helping doctors and nurses respond to everything from flu epidemics to avalanches. Even in the immensely complex world of surgery, a simple 90-second variant has cut the rate of fatalities by more than a third.</p> <p>In riveting stories, Gawande takes us from Austria, where an emergency checklist saved a drowning victim who had spent half an hour underwater, to Michigan, where a cleanliness checklist in intensive care units virtually eliminated a type of deadly hospital infection. He explains how checklists actually work to prompt striking and immediate improvements.

When he finds a local hunting outfitter dead, splayed out on the woodpile behind his state-owned home, he takes it personally. There had to be a reason that the outfitter, with whom he's had run-ins before, chose his backyard, his woodpile to die in. Even after the \"outfitter murders,\" as they have been dubbed by the local press after the discovery of the two more bodies, are solved, Joe continues to investigate, uneasy with the easy explanation offered by the local police. </p> <p>As Joe digs deeper into the murders, he soon discovers that the outfitter brought more than death to his backdoor: he brought Joe an endangered species, thought to be extinct, which is now living in his woodpile. But if word of the existence of this endangered species gets out, it will destroy any chance of InterWest, a multi-national natural gas company, building an oil pipeline that would bring the company billions of dollars across Wyoming, through the mountains and forests of Twelve Sleep. The closer Joe comes to the truth behind the outfitter murders, the endangered species and InterWest, the closer he comes to losing everything he holds dear. </p>","releaseDate":"2011-02-14","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books"}],"length":"7h 50m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Crime Fiction","url":"18574598011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/004252/bk_reco_004252_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51BiQI05M3L","asin":"B004TTK3L4","subHeading":"A Joe Pickett Novel","title":"Savage Run","authors":"C.

When an eccentric Englishman named Phileas Fogg makes a daring wager that he can circle the globe in just 80 days, it’s the beginning of a breathlessly-paced world tour. With his devoted servant Passepartout at his side, Fogg sets off on an adventurous journey filled with amazing encounters and wild mishaps. Pursued all the way by the bumbling Detective Fix, who believes the two travelers are bank robbers on the run, Fogg and Passepartout must use every means of transportation known to 19th-century man - including a hot-air balloon, a locomotive, and an elephant - to win the bet. When Jules Verne’s delightful tale of two globetrotting gentlemen first appeared in 1873, it won the hearts - and imaginations - of readers across Europe. Published chapter by chapter over the course of many months, <i>Around the World in 80 Days</i> aroused so much excitement that readers placed bets on the outcome of Phileas Fogg’s race against time.</p>","releaseDate":"2011-10-04","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books"}],"length":"6h 47m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/004777/bk_reco_004777_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"416A4N43qDL","asin":"1978676484","title":"The Mysterious Island (AmazonClassics Edition)","authors":"Jules Verne","narrators":"James Langton","length":"20 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"51gQv-7DrRL","asin":"2291045245","title":"The Call of the Wild","authors":"Jack London","narrators":"Michael Scott","length":"3 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"51evwEA4ZrL","asin":"B076HSP1FT","title":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea","authors":"Jules Verne","narrators":"David Linski","length":"11 hrs and 13 mins"},{"cover":"51HZXUdondL","asin":"B071VTQNML","title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","authors":"Jules Verne, Frederick Amadeus Malleson - translator","narrators":"Derek Perkins","length":"8 hrs and 40 mins"},{"cover":"41xY7I+y3rL","asin":"1978676603","title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel (AmazonClassics Edition)","authors":"Baroness Orczy","narrators":"Michael Page","length":"8 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"61f8oxmdSWL","asin":"B005ZIMPJG","title":"Great Expectations","authors":"Charles Dickens","narrators":"Simon Prebble","length":"18 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51c1MXWXQ+L","asin":"2291045156","title":"The Red Badge of Courage","authors":"Stephen Crane","narrators":"Michael Scott","length":"4 hrs and 38 mins"},{"cover":"51f3Z+hWpvL","asin":"B07HPC63N5","title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","authors":"Lewis Carroll","narrators":"Michael Scott","length":"2 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"51BnRs7lyXL","asin":"B0195OU42K","title":"Shadow Spinner","authors":"Susan Fletcher","narrators":"Suzanne Toren","length":"6 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"51Vtt+msCJL","asin":"B085Y4KH6S","title":"The War of the Worlds","authors":"H.

An emaciated young lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, is led to a freezing isolation cell in a Moscow prison, handcuffed to a bed rail, and beaten to death by eight police officers. His crime? To testify against the Russian Interior Ministry officials who were involved in a conspiracy to steal $230 million of taxes paid to the state by one of the world's most successful hedge funds. Magnitsky's brutal killing has remained uninvestigated and unpunished to this day.

Fourteen-year-old Ted Systead and his father were camping peacefully beneath the rugged peaks and sweeping sky when the unimaginable happened: Ted's father was mauled by a grizzly bear and dragged to his death. </p> <p>Now, 20 years later, as a special agent for the Department of the Interior, Ted is called back to investigate a crime that echoes the horror of that night. Only this time the victim was tied to a tree before the animal's attack. Ted teams up with one of the park officers - a man named Monty, whose pleasant exterior masks an all-too-vivid knowledge of the area. Residents of the nearby community are less than forthcoming. Suspicious of outsiders and intimately connected to the wilderness that surrounds them, they confront their fellow man and nature with equal measures of reverence and brutality. As the days pass with no clear answers, not only is human life at stake but so too is that of a majestic creature who carries with it valuable evidence. Ted's search for truth takes him far into the wilderness, on the trail of a killer, and eventually to a shocking and unexpectedly personal conclusion. </p> <p>Rich in atmosphere and evocative, lush descriptions, <i>The Wild Inside</i> is a gripping debut novel about the wondrously perilous intersection between man and nature. </p>","releaseDate":"2015-06-16","publishers":[{"name":"Blackstone Audio, Inc."}],"length":"13h 1m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Crime Fiction","url":"18574598011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/007701/bk_blak_007701_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61+QqW3Ht9L","asin":"B01E9G82TQ","subHeading":"A Novel of Suspense","title":"Mortal Fall","authors":"Christine Carbo","narrators":"R.C.

The police interview everyone they can find who came in contact with the college students and learn that the women were lovers who had been keeping their relationship secret from their Evangelical parents in Georgia. When two corpses are discovered - the bones picked clean by coyotes - rumors spread that the women were stalked and killed by the increasingly aggressive canines. Faced with a statewide panic, Maine's governor places an emergency bounty on every dead coyote, and wildlife officials are tasked with collecting the carcasses. Despite some misgivings, Bowditch does his grisly job. But he finds his complacency challenged by his new girlfriend, the brilliant but volatile biologist Stacey Stevens, who insists coyotes merely scavenged the bodies after the women were murdered. When Stacey herself disappears on the outskirts of the Hundred Mile Wilderness, Bowditch realizes that locating her means he must also discover the truth behind what happened to the two hikers. Were the young women really killed by coyotes, or, as Stacey insisted, were they murdered by the most dangerous animal in the North Woods? </p>","releaseDate":"2015-06-16","publishers":[{"name":"Macmillan Audio"}],"length":"9h 23m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Mystery","url":"18574606011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/aren/002004/bk_aren_002004_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51gzaAmYiKL","asin":"B00WZZ6EY4","title":"The Bear Trap","authors":"Paul Doiron","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"42 mins"},{"cover":"51KLzpK6MJL","asin":"B07D5HJP9N","subHeading":"A Mike Bowditch Short Mystery","title":"Rabid","authors":"Paul Doiron","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"1 hr and 16 mins"},{"cover":"512TFs+JEaL","asin":"1250751535","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"One Last Lie","authors":"Paul Doiron","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"9 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"51090wdPrEL","asin":"B00RKO2M8W","title":"Poacher's Son","authors":"Paul Doiron","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"9 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51bVWj8lj-L","asin":"125078560X","subHeading":"A Mike Bowditch Short Mystery","title":"The Imposter","authors":"Paul Doiron","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"1 hr and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51KnG5kVQkL","asin":"1980021821","title":"Dark Sky","authors":"C.J.

The Confederate Army of Northern Virginia is invading the North. General Robert E. Lee has made this daring and massive move with 70,000 men in a determined effort to draw out the Union Army of the Potomac and mortally wound it. His right hand is General James Longstreet, a brooding man who is loyal to Lee but stubbornly argues against his plan. Opposing them is an unknown factor: General George Meade, who has taken command of the Army only two days before what will be perhaps the crucial battle of the Civil War.</p> <p>In the four most bloody and courageous days of our nation's history, two armies fight for two conflicting dreams.

Each step closer to the truth takes Ethan further from the world he thought he knew, from the man he thought he was, until he must face a horrifying fact - he may never get out of Wayward Pines alive.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>2013 International Thriller Award Nominee</i></p>","releaseDate":"2012-08-21","publishers":[{"name":"Brilliance Audio"}],"length":"8h 33m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Horror","url":"18574490011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/brll/004082/bk_brll_004082_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51MOnN1XyZL","asin":"B008OKIZ64","subHeading":"A Thriller","title":"Run","authors":"Blake Crouch","narrators":"Phil Gigante","length":"8 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"519U+U6RTSL","asin":"1984886878","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Recursion","authors":"Blake Crouch","narrators":"Jon Lindstrom, Abby Craden","length":"10 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"51cM1xXdA-L","asin":"B01CUKULGA","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Dark Matter","authors":"Blake Crouch","narrators":"Jon Lindstrom","length":"10 hrs and 8 mins"},{"cover":"61nqma06OFL","asin":"B07D2JPMTK","title":"Beware the Past","authors":"Joy Ellis","narrators":"Antony Ferguson","length":"11 hrs and 3 mins"},{"cover":"61QcBTTxA4L","asin":"B06ZXTF554","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Dead Certain","authors":"Adam Mitzner","narrators":"Erin Bennett","length":"8 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51U5MA+LJEL","asin":"B075GXVDKQ","title":"Warning Light","authors":"David Ricciardi","narrators":"Jonathan Davis","length":"9 hrs and 13 mins"},{"cover":"51A2rMJzGPL","asin":"B002V1J8L8","subHeading":"John Ceepak, Book 1","title":"Tilt-a-Whirl","authors":"Chris Grabenstein","narrators":"Jeff Woodman","length":"8 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51YfNaoD64L","asin":"B07NDKJDND","subHeading":"Kate Marshall, Book 1","title":"Nine Elms","authors":"Robert Bryndza","narrators":"Kristin Atherton","length":"12 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"51ehFrNjuQL","asin":"B01FI6OP5G","subHeading":"Detective Jude Fontaine Mysteries, Book 1","title":"The Body Reader","authors":"Anne Frasier","narrators":"Emily Sutton-Smith","length":"8 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"61qZk4+W0rL","asin":"B07DVC5WYX","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Sweet Little Lies","authors":"Caz Frear","narrators":"Jane Collingwood","length":"11 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"51QffrmRrDL","asin":"B00HZOLWH4","subHeading":"Xenogenesis, Book 1","title":"Dawn","authors":"Octavia E.

Parker will love this outstanding first novel, in which <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Craig Johnson introduces Sheriff Walt Longmire of Wyoming's Absaroka County. Johnson draws on his deep attachment to the American West to produce a literary mystery of stunning authenticity, full of memorable characters. After 25 years as sheriff of Absaroka County, Walt Longmire's hopes of finishing out his tenure in peace are dashed when Cody Pritchard is found dead near the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. Two years earlier, Cody has been one of four high school boys given suspended sentences for raping a local Cheyenne girl.

Few of these assaults were properly handled by either the university or local authorities. In this Missoula is also typical. </p> <p>A DOJ report released in December of 2014 estimates 110,000 women between the ages of 18 and 24 are raped each year. Krakauer's devastating narrative of what happened in Missoula makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault. </p> <p>Acquaintance rape is a crime like no other. Unlike burglary or embezzlement or any other felony, the victim often comes under more suspicion than the alleged perpetrator. This is especially true if the victim is sexually active, if she had been drinking prior to the assault - and if the man she accuses plays on a popular sports team. The vanishingly small but highly publicized incidents of false accusations are often used to dismiss her claims in the press. If the case goes to trial, the woman's entire personal life becomes fair game for defense attorneys. </p> <p>This brutal reality goes a long way toward explaining why acquaintance rape is the most underreported crime in America. In addition to physical trauma, its victims often suffer devastating psychological damage that leads to feelings of shame, emotional paralysis, and stigmatization. PTSD rates for rape victims are estimated to be 50 percent - higher than soldiers returning from war. </p>","releaseDate":"2015-04-21","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"length":"11h 51m ","categories":[{"name":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"18574641011"},{"name":"Social Sciences","url":"18574731011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/004107/bk_rand_004107_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51OMMgkxBfL","asin":"B002UZZ922","subHeading":"A Story of Violent Faith","title":"Under the Banner of Heaven","authors":"Jon Krakauer","narrators":"Scott Brick","length":"12 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51bFpLKj79L","asin":"B002V0M5NM","subHeading":"The Odyssey of Pat Tillman","title":"Where Men Win Glory","authors":"Jon Krakauer","narrators":"Scott Brick","length":"13 hrs and 8 mins"},{"cover":"517c54Z2BVL","asin":"B002V0QF9M","subHeading":"A Personal Account of the Mt.

The passengers were anxious. Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone, and for months its U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the <i>Lusitania</i> was one of the era's great transatlantic \"Greyhounds\", and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. He knew, moreover, that his ship--the fastest then in service--could outrun any threat. </p> <p>Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger's U-boat,but told no one. As U-20 and the <i>Lusitania</i> made their ways toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small--hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more--all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. </p> <p>It is a story that many of us think we know but don't, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour, mystery, and real-life suspense, <i>Dead Wake</i> brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope Riddle to President Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. Gripping and important, <i>Dead Wake</i> captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster that helped place America on the road to war.</p>","releaseDate":"2015-03-10","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"length":"13h 4m ","categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Americas","url":"18573526011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/004066/bk_rand_004066_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51i0I2TGMgL","asin":"B004WPQ3V4","subHeading":"Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin","title":"In the Garden of Beasts","authors":"Erik Larson","narrators":"Stephen Hoye","length":"12 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"41YZGRy1Z-L","asin":"B002V8MKHA","title":"Thunderstruck","authors":"Erik Larson","narrators":"Bob Balaban","length":"11 hrs and 56 mins"},{"cover":"51kQbBa2QTL","asin":"0593167171","subHeading":"A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz","title":"The Splendid and the Vile","authors":"Erik Larson","narrators":"John Lee, Erik Larson","length":"17 hrs and 49 mins"},{"cover":"51eOvofPocL","asin":"0593163540","subHeading":"A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History","title":"Isaac's Storm","authors":"Erik Larson","narrators":"Richard Davidson","length":"8 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51ciHSEfLiL","asin":"B002UZLF8Y","subHeading":"The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History","title":"The Great Influenza","authors":"John M.

The Pentagon has officially confirmed more than 150 of Kyles kills (the previous American record was 109), but it has declined to verify the astonishing total number for this book. Iraqi insurgents feared Kyle so much they named him <i>al-Shaitan</i> (\"the devil\") and placed a bounty on his head. Kyle earned legendary status among his fellow SEALs, Marines, and U.S. Army soldiers, whom he protected with deadly accuracy from rooftops and stealth positions. Gripping and unforgettable, Kyle’s masterful account of his extraordinary battlefield experiences ranks as one of the great war memoirs of all time. </p> <p>A native Texan who learned to shoot on childhood hunting trips with his father, Kyle was a champion saddle-bronc rider prior to joining the Navy. After 9/11, he was thrust onto the front lines of the War on Terror, and soon found his calling as a world-class sniper who performed best under fire. He recorded a personal-record 2,100-yard kill shot outside Baghdad; in Fallujah, Kyle braved heavy fire to rescue a group of Marines trapped on a street; in Ramadi, he stared down insurgents with his pistol in close combat. Kyle talks honestly about the pain of war - of twice being shot and experiencing the tragic deaths of two close friends. </p> <p><i>American Sniper</i> also honors Kyle's fellow warriors, who raised hell on and off the battlefield.

Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>New York Times</i> journalist and author Timothy Egan follows a half-dozen families and their communities through the rise and fall of the region, going from sod huts to new framed houses to huddling in basements with the windows sealed by damp sheets in a futile effort to keep the dust out. </p> <p>He follows their desperate attempts to carry on through blinding black blizzards, crop failure, and the death of loved ones. Drawing on the voices of those who stayed and survived, those who, now in their eighties and nineties, will soon carry their memories to the grave, Egan tells a story of endurance and heroism against the backdrop of the Great Depression. </p> <p>Egan captures the very voice of the time, its grit, pathos, and abiding heroism, as only great history can. Combining the human drama of <i>Isaac's Storm</i> with the sweep of <i>The American People in the Great Depression</i>, <i>The Worst Hard Time</i> is a lasting and important work of American history. </p>","releaseDate":"2006-04-13","publishers":[{"name":"Tantor Audio"}],"length":"11h 45m ","categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Americas","url":"18573526011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/000177/bk_tant_000177_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51isiMcpkLL","asin":"B01B57RCFW","subHeading":"The Irish Revolutionary Who Became an American Hero","title":"The Immortal Irishman","authors":"Timothy Egan","narrators":"Gerard Doyle","length":"14 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"61yozG4sg+L","asin":"B01H62F8G0","subHeading":"The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America","title":"White Trash","authors":"Nancy Isenberg","narrators":"Kirsten Potter","length":"15 hrs and 5 mins"},{"cover":"6132R6AHGjL","asin":"125031724X","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Four Winds","authors":"Kristin Hannah","narrators":"Julia Whelan","length":"15 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"51DxIBZiPRL","asin":"1621888614","subHeading":"Pearl Spence Novels, Book 1","title":"A Cup of Dust: A Novel of the Dust Bowl","authors":"Susie Finkbeiner","narrators":"Tavia Gilbert","length":"9 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"61iv7KCm2oL","asin":"B00DVOT0EO","subHeading":"The True Story of the School at Weedpatch Camp","title":"Children of the Dust Bowl","authors":"Jerry Stanley","narrators":"Fred Sullivan","length":"1 hr and 23 mins"},{"cover":"51803pjQJyL","asin":"154911669X","subHeading":"Europe Between Hitler and Stalin","title":"Bloodlands","authors":"Timothy Snyder","narrators":"Ralph Cosham","length":"18 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"51JKliN6mGL","asin":"B071WDCCNZ","subHeading":"The Southern Plains in the 1930s","title":"Dust Bowl","authors":"Donald Worster","narrators":"Sean Runnette","length":"11 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51RI+80wLGL","asin":"0593148878","subHeading":"From Canterbury to Rome in Search of a Faith","title":"A Pilgrimage to Eternity","authors":"Timothy Egan","narrators":"Timothy Egan","length":"12 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"61Qg4x7NqzL","asin":"B00382WC08","title":"The Coming of the Third Reich","authors":"Richard J.

Now Kathy finds herself the target of a government inquiry and outrage from the dead soldier’s platoon-mates. Soon she finds herself in the sights of a sniper, as well.

Burnham, the famed architect who coordinated the talents of Frederick Olmsted, Louis Sullivan, and others to build it. Dr. Henry H. Holmes combined the fair's appeal with his own fatal charms to lure scores of women to their deaths. Whereas the fair marked the birth of a new epoch in American history, Holmes marked the emergence of a new American archetype, the serial killer, who thrived on the very forces then transforming the country.</p> <p>In deft prose, Larson conveys Burnham's herculean challenge to build the White City in less than 18 months. At the same time, he describes how, in a malign parody of the achievements of the fair's builders, Holmes built his own World's Fair Hotel - a torture palace complete with a gas chamber and crematorium. Throughout the book, tension mounts on two fronts: Will Burnham complete the White City before the millions of visitors arrive at its gates?

Learn how authors \"write into the gap\" to flesh out-or, in some cases, reimagine altogether-old stories, making them new for new readerships with different values. By examining what makes these heroes such compelling characters, you'll see how they provide a window to better understand ourselves. </p> <p>From the beginnings of world literature through today's bestsellers, look at what makes characters successful-and how they reflect our changing cultural mores. For instance, after the horrors of global war in the 20th century, the world was waiting for a hero like Frodo Baggins, J.R.R. Tolkien's meek hobbit hero, someone called to duty rather than born strong and fearless. </p> <p>You'll also examine ways that great heroes have changed the course of history, defining nations and redefining our sense of self and our relationships.

When a blizzard descends on the coast, Bowditch is called to the rustic cabin of a terrified couple. A raving and half-frozen man has appeared at their door, claiming his friend is lost in the storm.

The dead man is a notorious drug dealer, and state police detectives suspect it was his own friend who killed him. </p> <p>Bowditch isn’t so sure, but his vow not to interfere in the case is tested when he finds himself powerfully attracted to a beautiful woman with a dark past and a troubled young son.

Meanwhile, an anonymous tormentor has decided to make the new warden’s life a living hell. </p> <p>Alone and outgunned, Bowditch turns for assistance to his old friend, the legendary bush pilot Charley Stevens.

The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> proclaimed that her work \"draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.\" <i>Gone Girl</i>'s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn. </p> <p>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. </p> <p>Under mounting pressure from the police and the media - as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents - the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter - but is he really a killer? </p> <p>As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet? </p> <p>With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.</p>","releaseDate":"2012-06-05","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"length":"19h 11m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Mystery","url":"18574606011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/003101/bk_rand_003101_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51k1fCnXenL","asin":"B002V1NTTU","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Sharp Objects","authors":"Gillian Flynn","narrators":"Ann Marie Lee","length":"9 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"51cSlRutl5L","asin":"B002VA9TOU","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Dark Places","authors":"Gillian Flynn","narrators":"Rebecca Lowman, Cassandra Campbell, Mark Deakins, and others","length":"13 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"41FIQf-xzhL","asin":"B00QXW5GYY","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Girl on the Train","authors":"Paula Hawkins","narrators":"Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey, India Fisher","length":"10 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"51n-0yG7y1L","asin":"B002UZMWNG","subHeading":"The Millennium Series, Book 1","title":"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo","authors":"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland - translator","narrators":"Simon Vance","length":"16 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51rtHzQEASL","asin":"B00K8F589A","title":"Big Little Lies","authors":"Liane Moriarty","narrators":"Caroline Lee","length":"15 hrs and 55 mins"},{"cover":"51czP2HnV9L","asin":"B0773W3MZW","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Woman in the Window","authors":"A.

A woman has reportedly struck a deer on a lonely coast road. When the game warden arrives on the scene, he finds blood in the road—but both the driver and the deer have vanished. And the state trooper assigned to the accident appears strangely unconcerned. The details of the disappearance seem eerily familiar. Seven years earlier, a jury convicted lobsterman Erland Jefferts of the rape and murder of a wealthy college student and sentenced him to life in prison. For all but his most fanatical defenders, justice was served. But when the missing woman is found brutalized in a manner that suggests Jefferts may have been framed, Bowditch receives an ominous warning from state prosecutors to stop asking questions. </p> <p>For Bowditch, whose own life was recently shattered by a horrific act of violence, doing nothing is not an option. His clandestine investigation reopens old wounds between Maine locals and rich summer residents and puts both his own life and that of the woman he loves in jeopardy. As he closes in on his quarry, he suddenly discovers how dangerous his opponents are, and how far they will go to prevent him from bringing a killer to justice.</p>","releaseDate":"2011-06-21","publishers":[{"name":"Macmillan Audio"}],"length":"9h 39m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Mystery","url":"18574606011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/aren/001245/bk_aren_001245_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51090wdPrEL","asin":"B00RKO2M8W","title":"Poacher's Son","authors":"Paul Doiron","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"9 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51gzaAmYiKL","asin":"B00WZZ6EY4","title":"The Bear Trap","authors":"Paul Doiron","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"42 mins"},{"cover":"51KLzpK6MJL","asin":"B07D5HJP9N","subHeading":"A Mike Bowditch Short Mystery","title":"Rabid","authors":"Paul Doiron","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"1 hr and 16 mins"},{"cover":"512TFs+JEaL","asin":"1250751535","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"One Last Lie","authors":"Paul Doiron","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"9 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"51bVWj8lj-L","asin":"125078560X","subHeading":"A Mike Bowditch Short Mystery","title":"The Imposter","authors":"Paul Doiron","narrators":"Henry Leyva","length":"1 hr and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51KnG5kVQkL","asin":"1980021821","title":"Dark Sky","authors":"C.J.
